    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;LA FAUTE DE L&rsquo;ABBE MOURET&rsquo; was, with respect to the date of publication,
      the fourth volume of M. Zola&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rougon-Macquart&rsquo; series; but in the
      amended and final scheme of that great literary undertaking, it occupies
      the ninth place. It proceeds from the sixth volume of the series, &lsquo;The
      Conquest of Plassans;&rsquo; which is followed by the two works that deal with
      the career of Octave Mouret, Abbe Serge Mouret&rsquo;s elder brother. In &lsquo;The
      Conquest of Plassans,&rsquo; Serge and his half-witted sister, Desiree, are seen
      in childhood at their home in Plassans, which is wrecked by the doings of
      a certain Abbe Faujas and his relatives. Serge Mouret grows up, is called
      by an instinctive vocation to the priesthood, and becomes parish priest of
      Les Artaud, a well-nigh pagan hamlet in one of those bare, burning
      stretches of country with which Provence abounds. And here it is that &lsquo;La
      Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret&rsquo; opens in the old ruinous church, perched upon a
      hillock in full view of the squalid village, the arid fields, and the
      great belts of rock which shut in the landscape all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two elements in this remarkable story, which, from the
      standpoint of literary style, has never been excelled by anything that M.
      Zola has since written; and one may glance at it therefore from two points
      of view. Taking it under its sociological and religious aspect, it will be
      found to be an indirect indictment of the celibacy of the priesthood; that
      celibacy, contrary to Nature&rsquo;s fundamental law, which assuredly has
      largely influenced the destinies of the Roman Catholic Church. To that
      celibacy, and to all the evils that have sprang from it, may be ascribed
      much of the irreligion current in France to-day. The periodical reports on
      criminality issued by the French Ministers of Justice since the foundation
      of the Republic in 1871, supply materials for a most formidable indictment
      of that vow of perpetual chastity which Rome exacts from her clergy.
      Nowadays it is undoubtedly too late for Rome to go back upon that vow and
      thereby transform the whole of her sacerdotal organisation; but, perhaps,
      had she done so in past times, before the spirit of inquiry and free
      examination came into being, she might have assured herself many more
      centuries of supremacy than have fallen to her lot. But she has ever
      sought to dissociate the law of the Divinity from the law of Nature, as
      though indeed the latter were but the invention of the Fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, M. Zola&rsquo;s hero, finds himself placed between the law of the
      Divinity and the law of Nature: and the struggle waged within him by those
      two forces is a terrible one. That which training has implanted in his
      mind proves the stronger, and, so far as the canons of the Church can
      warrant it, he saves his soul. But the problem is not quite frankly put by
      M. Zola; for if Abbe Mouret transgresses he does so unwittingly, at a time
      when he is unconscious of his priesthood and has no memory of any vow.
      When the truth flashes upon him he is horrified with himself, and
      forthwith returns to the Church. A further struggle between the contending
      forces then certainly ensues, and ends in the final victory of the Church.
      But it must at least be said that in the lapses which occur in real life
      among the Roman priesthood, the circumstances are altogether different
      from those which M. Zola has selected for his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that in &lsquo;La Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret,&rsquo; betwixt lifelike
      glimpses of French rural life, the author transports us to a realm of
      poesy and imagination. This is, indeed, so true that he has introduced
      into his work all the ideas on which he had based an early unfinished poem
      called &lsquo;Genesis.&rsquo; He carries us to an enchanted garden, the Paradou&mdash;a
      name which one need hardly say is Provencal for Paradise*&mdash;and there
      Serge Mouret, on recovering from brain fever, becomes, as it were, a new
      Adam by the side of a new Eve, the fair and winsome Albine. All this part
      of the book, then, is poetry in prose. The author has remembered the ties
      which link Rousseau to the realistic school of fiction, and, as in the
      pages of Jean-Jacques, trees, springs, mountains, rocks, and flowers
      become animated beings and claim their place in the world&rsquo;s mechanism. One
      may indeed go back far beyond Rousseau, even to Lucretius himself; for
      more than once we are irresistibly reminded of Lucretian scenes, above
      which through M. Zola&rsquo;s pages there seems to hover the pronouncement of
      Sophocles:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     No ordinance of man shall override
     The settled laws of Nature and of God;
     Not written these in pages of a book,
     Nor were they framed to-day, nor yesterday;
     We know not whence they are; but this we know,
     That they from all eternity have been,
     And shall to all eternity endure.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * There is a village called Paradou in Provence, between
    Les Baux and Arles.
</pre>
    <p>
      And if we pass to the young pair whose duo of love is sung amidst the
      varied voices of creation, we are irresistibly reminded of the Paul and
      Virginia of St. Pierre, and the Daphnis and Chloe of Longus. Beside them,
      in their marvellous garden, lingers a memory too of Manon and Des Grieux,
      with a suggestion of Lauzun and a glimpse of the art of Fragonard. All
      combine, all contribute&mdash;from the great classics to the eighteenth
      century <i>petits maitres</i>&mdash;to build up a story of love&rsquo;s rise in
      the human breast in answer to Nature&rsquo;s promptings.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Zola wrote &lsquo;La Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret&rsquo; one summer under the trees of
      his garden, mindful the while of gardens that he had known in childhood:
      the flowery expanse which had stretched before his grandmother&rsquo;s home at
      Pont-au-Beraud and the wild estate of Galice, between Roquefavour and
      Aix-en-Provence, through which he had roamed as a lad with friends then
      boys like himself: Professor Baille and Cezanne, the painter. And into his
      description of the wondrous Paradou he has put all his remembrance of the
      gardens and woods of Provence, where many a plant and flower thrive with a
      luxuriance unknown to England. True, in order to refresh his memory and
      avoid mistakes, he consulted various horticultural manuals whilst he was
      writing; of which circumstance captious critics have readily laid hold, to
      proclaim that the description of the Paradou is a mere florist&rsquo;s
      catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is nothing of the kind. The florist who might dare to offer such a
      catalogue to the public would be speedily assailed by all the
      horticultural journalists of England and all the customers of villadom.
      For M. Zola avails himself of a poet&rsquo;s license to crowd marvel upon
      marvel, to exaggerate nature&rsquo;s forces, to transform the tiniest blooms
      into giant examples of efflorescence, and to mingle even the seasons one
      with the other. But all this was premeditated; there was a picture before
      his mind&rsquo;s eye, and that picture he sought to trace with his pen,
      regardless of all possible objections. It is the poet&rsquo;s privilege to do
      this and even to be admired for it. It would be easy for some leaned
      botanist, some expert zoologist, to demolish Milton from the standpoint of
      their respective sciences, but it would be absurd to do so. We ask of the
      poet the flowers of his imagination, and the further he carries us from
      the sordid realities, the limited possibilities of life, the more are we
      grateful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And M. Zola&rsquo;s Paradou is a flight of fancy, even as its mistress, the
      fair, loving, guileless Albine, whose smiles and whose tears alike go to
      our hearts, is the daughter of imagination. She is a flower&mdash;the very
      flower of life&rsquo;s youth&mdash;in the midst of all the blossoms of her
      garden. She unfolds to life and to love even as they unfold; she loves
      rapturously even as they do under the sun and the azure; and she dies with
      them when the sun&rsquo;s caress is gone and the chill of winter has fallen. At
      the thought of her, one instinctively remembers Malherbe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ode A Du
      Perrier:&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She to this earth belonged, where beauty fast
          To direst fate is borne:
     A rose, she lasted, as the roses last,
          Only for one brief morn.
</pre>
    <p>
      French painters have made subjects of many episodes in M. Zola&rsquo;s works,
      but none has been more popular with them than Albine&rsquo;s pathetic, perfumed
      death amidst the flowers. I know several paintings of great merit which
      that touching incident has inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine, if more or less unreal, a phantasm, the spirit as it were of
      Nature incarnate in womanhood, is none the less the most delightful of M.
      Zola&rsquo;s heroines. She smiles at us like the vision of perfect beauty and
      perfect love which rises before us when our hearts are yet young and full
      of illusions. She is the ideal, the very quintessence of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Serge Mouret, her lover, we find a man who, in more than one respect,
      recalls M. Zola&rsquo;s later hero, the Abbe Froment of &lsquo;Lourdes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rome.&rsquo; He
      has the same loving, yearning nature; he is born&mdash;absolutely like
      Abbe Froment&mdash;of an unbelieving father and a mother of mystical mind.
      But unlike Froment he cannot shake off the shackles of his priesthood.
      Reborn to life after his dangerous illness, he relapses into the religion
      of death, the religion which regards life as impurity, which denies
      Nature&rsquo;s laws, and so often wrecks human existence, as if indeed that had
      been the Divine purpose in setting man upon earth. His struggles suggest
      various passages in &lsquo;Lourdes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rome.&rsquo; In fact, in writing those works,
      M. Zola must have had his earlier creation in mind. There are passages in
      &lsquo;La Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret&rsquo; culled from the writings of the Spanish Jesuit
      Fathers and the &lsquo;Imitation&rsquo; of Thomas a Kempis that recur almost word for
      word in the Trilogy of the Three Cities. Some might regard this as
      evidence of the limitation of M. Zola&rsquo;s powers, but I think differently. I
      consider that he has in both instances designedly taken the same type of
      priest in order to show how he may live under varied circumstances; for in
      the earlier instance he has led him to one goal, and in the later one to
      another. And the passages of prayer, entreaty, and spiritual conflict
      simply recur because they are germane, even necessary, to the subject in
      both cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the minor characters that figure in &lsquo;La Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret&rsquo; the
      chief thing to be said is that they are lifelike. If Serge is almost
      wholly spiritual, if Albine is the daughter of poesy, they, the others,
      are of the earth earthy. As a result of their appearance on the scene,
      there are some powerful contrasting passages in the book. Archangias, the
      coarse and brutal Christian Brother who serves as a foil to Abbe Mouret;
      La Teuse, the priest&rsquo;s garrulous old housekeeper; Desiree, his &lsquo;innocent&rsquo; 
      sister, a grown woman with the mind of a child and an almost crazy
      affection for every kind of bird and beast, are all admirably portrayed.
      Old Bambousse, though one sees but little of him, stands out as a genuine
      type of the hard-headed French peasant, who invariably places pecuniary
      considerations before all others. And Fortune and Rosalie, Vincent and
      Catherine, and their companions, are equally true to nature. It need
      hardly be said that there is many a village in France similar to Les
      Artaud. That hamlet&rsquo;s shameless, purely animal life has in no wise been
      over-pictured by M. Zola. Those who might doubt him need not go as far as
      Provence to find such communities. Many Norman hamlets are every whit as
      bad, and, in Normandy, conditions are aggravated by a marked predilection
      for the bottle, which, as French social-scientists have been pointing out
      for some years now, is fast hastening the degenerescence of the peasantry,
      both morally and physically.

      With reference to the English version of &lsquo;La Faute de l&rsquo;Abbe Mouret&rsquo; 
      herewith presented, I may just say that I have subjected it to
      considerable revision and have retranslated all the more important
      passages myself.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      As La Teuse entered the church she rested her broom and feather-brush
      against the altar. She was late, as she had that day began her half-yearly
      wash. Limping more than ever in her haste and hustling the benches, she
      went down the church to ring the <i>Angelus</i>. The bare, worn bell-rope
      dangled from the ceiling near the confessional, and ended in a big knot
      greasy from handling. Again and again, with regular jumps, she hung
      herself upon it; and then let her whole bulky figure go with it, whirling
      in her petticoats, her cap awry, and her blood rushing to her broad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set her cap straight with a little pat, she came back breathless to
      give a hasty sweep before the altar. Every day the dust persistently
      settled between the disjoined boards of the platform. Her broom rummaged
      among the corners with an angry rumble. Then she lifted the altar cover
      and was sorely vexed to find that the large upper cloth, already darned in
      a score of places, was again worn through in the very middle, so as to
      show the under cloth, which in its turn was so worn and so transparent
      that one could see the consecrated stone, embedded in the painted wood of
      the altar. La Teuse dusted the linen, yellow from long usage, and plied
      her feather-brush along the shelf against which she set the liturgical
      altar-cards. Then, climbing upon a chair, she removed the yellow cotton
      covers from the crucifix and two of the candlesticks. The brass of the
      latter was tarnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; she muttered, &lsquo;they really want a clean! I must give them a
      polish up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then hopping on one leg, swaying and stumping heavily enough to drive in
      the flagstones, she hastened to the sacristy for the Missal, which she
      placed unopened on the lectern on the Epistle side, with its edges turned
      towards the middle of the altar. And afterwards she lighted the two
      candles. As she went off with her broom, she gave a glance round her to
      make sure that the abode of the Divinity had been put in proper order. All
      was still, save that the bell-rope near the confessional still swung
      between roof and floor with a sinuous sweep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret had just come down to the sacristy, a small and chilly
      apartment, which a passage separated from his dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; said La Teuse, laying her broom aside.
      &lsquo;Oh! you have been lazy this morning! Do you know it&rsquo;s a quarter past
      six?&rsquo; And without allowing the smiling young priest sufficient time to
      reply, she added &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a scolding to give you. There&rsquo;s another hole in the
      cloth again. There&rsquo;s no sense in it. We have only one other, and I&rsquo;ve been
      ruining my eyes over it these three days in trying to mend it. You will
      leave our poor Lord quite bare, if you go on like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret was still smiling. &lsquo;Jesus does not need so much linen, my good
      Teuse,&rsquo; he cheerfully replied. &lsquo;He is always warm, always royally received
      by those who love Him well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then stepping towards a small tap, he asked: &lsquo;Is my sister up yet? I have
      not seen her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mademoiselle Desiree has been down a long time,&rsquo; answered the
      servant, who was kneeling before an old kitchen sideboard in which the
      sacred vestments were kept. &lsquo;She is already with her fowls and rabbits.
      She was expecting some chicks to be hatched yesterday, and it didn&rsquo;t come
      off. So you can guess her excitement.&rsquo; Then the worthy woman broke off to
      inquire: &lsquo;The gold chasuble, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, who had washed his hands and stood reverently murmuring a
      prayer, nodded affirmatively. The parish possessed only three chasubles: a
      violet one, a black one, and one in cloth-of-gold. The last had to be used
      on the days when white, red, or green was prescribed by the ritual, and it
      was therefore an all important garment. La Teuse lifted it reverently from
      the shelf covered with blue paper, on which she laid it after each
      service; and having placed it on the sideboard, she cautiously removed the
      fine cloths which protected its embroidery. A golden lamb slumbered on a
      golden cross, surrounded by broad rays of gold. The gold tissue, frayed at
      the folds, broke out in little slender tufts; the embossed ornaments were
      getting tarnished and worn. There was perpetual anxiety, fluttering
      concern, at seeing it thus go off spangle by spangle. The priest had to
      wear it almost every day. And how on earth could it be replaced&mdash;how
      would they be able to buy the three chasubles whose place it took, when
      the last gold threads should be worn out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the chasuble La Teuse next laid out the stole, the maniple, the
      girdle, alb and amice. But her tongue still wagged while she crossed the
      stole with the maniple, and wreathed the girdle so as to trace the
      venerated initial of Mary&rsquo;s holy name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That girdle is not up to much now,&rsquo; she muttered; &lsquo;you will have to make
      up your mind to get another, your reverence. It wouldn&rsquo;t be very hard; I
      could plait you one myself if I only had some hemp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret made no answer. He was dressing the chalice at a small table.
      A large old silver-gilt chalice it was with a bronze base, which he had
      just taken from the bottom of a deal cupboard, in which the sacred vessels
      and linen, the Holy Oils, the Missals, candlesticks, and crosses were
      kept. Across the cup he laid a clean purificator, and on this set the
      silver-gilt paten, with the host in it, which he covered with a small lawn
      pall. As he was hiding the chalice by gathering together the folds in the
      veil of cloth of gold matching the chasuble, La Teuse exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, there&rsquo;s no corporal in the burse. Last night I took all the dirty
      purificators, palls, and corporals to wash them&mdash;separately, of
      course&mdash;not with the house-wash. By-the-bye, your reverence, I didn&rsquo;t
      tell you: I have just started the house-wash. A fine fat one it will be!
      Better than the last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then while the priest slipped a corporal into the burse and laid the
      latter on the veil, she went on quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-bye, I forgot! that gadabout Vincent hasn&rsquo;t come. Do you wish me
      to serve your mass, your reverence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest eyed her sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t a sin,&rsquo; she continued, with her genial smile. &lsquo;I did serve
      a mass once, in Monsieur Caffin&rsquo;s time. I serve it better, too, than
      ragamuffins who laugh like heathens at seeing a fly buzzing about the
      church. True I may wear a cap, I may be sixty years old, and as round as a
      tub, but I have more respect for our Lord than those imps of boys whom I
      caught only the other day playing at leap-frog behind the altar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was still looking at her and shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a hole this village is!&rsquo; she grumbled. &lsquo;Not a hundred and fifty
      people in it! There are days, like to-day, when you wouldn&rsquo;t find a living
      soul in Les Artaud. Even the babies in swaddling clothes are gone to the
      vineyards! And goodness knows what they do among such vines&mdash;vines
      that grow under the pebbles and look as dry as thistles! A perfect
      wilderness, three miles from any highway! Unless an angel comes down to
      serve your mass, your reverence, you&rsquo;ve only got me to help you, on my
      honour! or one of Mademoiselle Desiree&rsquo;s rabbits, no offence to your
      reverence!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment, however, Vincent, the Brichets&rsquo; younger son, gently
      opened the door of the sacristy. His shock of red hair and his little,
      glistening, grey eyes exasperated La Teuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the wretch!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s just been up to some mischief!
      Come on, you scamp, since his reverence is afraid I might dirty our Lord!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the lad, Abbe Mouret had taken up the amice. He kissed the cross
      embroidered in the centre of it, and for a second laid the cloth upon his
      head; then lowering it over the collar-band of his cassock, he crossed it
      and fastened the tapes, the right one over the left. He next donned the
      alb, the symbol of purity, beginning with the right sleeve. Vincent
      stooped and turned around him, adjusting the alb, in order that it should
      fall evenly all round him to a couple of inches from the ground. Then he
      presented the girdle to the priest, who fastened it tightly round his
      loins, as a reminder of the bonds wherewith the Saviour was bound in His
      Passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse remained standing there, feeling jealous and hurt and struggling
      to keep silence; but so great was the itching of her tongue, that she soon
      broke out once more: &lsquo;Brother Archangias has been here. He won&rsquo;t have a
      single child at school to-day. He went off again like a whirlwind to pull
      the brats&rsquo; ears in the vineyards. You had better see him. I believe he has
      got something to say to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret silenced her with a wave of the hand. Then he repeated the
      usual prayers while he took the maniple&mdash;which he kissed before
      slipping it over his left forearm, as a symbol of the practice of good
      works&mdash;and while crossing on his breast the stole, the symbol of his
      dignity and power. La Teuse had to help Vincent in the work of adjusting
      the chasuble, which she fastened together with slender tapes, so that it
      might not slip off behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holy Virgin! I had forgotten the cruets!&rsquo; she stammered, rushing to the
      cupboard. &lsquo;Come, look sharp, lad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Vincent filled the cruets, phials of coarse glass, while she
      hastened to take a clean finger-cloth from a drawer. Abbe Mouret, holding
      the chalice by its stem with his left hand, the fingers of his right
      resting meanwhile on the burse, then bowed profoundly, but without
      removing his biretta, to a black wooden crucifix, which hung over the
      side-board. The lad bowed too, and, bearing the cruets covered with the
      finger-cloth, led the way out of the sacristy, followed by the priest, who
      walked on with downcast eyes, absorbed in deep and prayerful meditation.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The empty church was quite white that May morning. The bell-rope near the
      confessional hung motionless once more. The little bracket light, with its
      stained glass shade, burned like a crimson splotch against the wall on the
      right of the tabernacle. Vincent, having set the cruets on the credence,
      came back and knelt just below the altar step on the left, while the
      priest, after rendering homage to the Holy Sacrament by a genuflexion,
      went up to the altar and there spread out the corporal, on the centre of
      which he placed the chalice. Then, having opened the Missal, he came down
      again. Another bend of the knee followed, and, after crossing himself and
      uttering aloud the formula, &lsquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and the
      Holy Ghost,&rsquo; he raised his joined hands to his breast, and entered on the
      great divine drama, with his countenance blanched by faith and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ad Deum qui loetificat juventutem meam</i>,&rsquo; gabbled Vincent, who,
      squatting on his heels, mumbled the responses of the antiphon and the
      psalm, while watching La Teuse as she roved about the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant was gazing at one of the candles with a troubled look. Her
      anxiety seemed to increase while the priest, bowing down with hands joined
      again, recited the <i>Confiteor</i>. She stood still, in her turn struck
      her breast, her head bowed, but still keeping a watchful eye on the taper.
      For another minute the priest&rsquo;s grave voice and the server&rsquo;s stammers
      alternated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Dominus vobiscum</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Et cum spiritu tuo</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the priest, spreading out his hands and afterwards again joining
      them, said with devout compunction: &lsquo;<i>Oremus</i>&rsquo; (Let us pray).
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse could now stand it no longer, but stepped behind the altar,
      reached the guttering candle, and trimmed it with the points of her
      scissors. Two large blobs of wax had already been wasted. When she came
      back again putting the benches straight on her way, and making sure that
      there was holy-water in the fonts, the priest, whose hands were resting on
      the edge of the altar-cloth, was praying in subdued tones. And at last he
      kissed the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him, the little church still looked wan in the pale light of early
      morn. The sun, as yet, was only level with the tiled roof. The <i>Kyrie
      Eleisons</i> rang quiveringly through that sort of whitewashed stable with
      flat ceiling and bedaubed beams. On either side three lofty windows of
      plain glass, most of them cracked or smashed, let in a raw light of chalky
      crudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The free air poured in as it listed, emphasising the naked poverty of the
      God of that forlorn village. At the far end of the church, above the big
      door which was never opened and the threshold of which was green with
      weeds, a boarded gallery&mdash;reached by a common miller&rsquo;s ladder&mdash;stretched
      from wall to wall. Dire were its creakings on festival days beneath the
      weight of wooden shoes. Near the ladder stood the confessional, with
      warped panels, painted a lemon yellow. Facing it, beside the little door,
      stood the font&mdash;a former holy-water stoup resting on a stonework
      pedestal. To the right and to the left, halfway down the church, two
      narrow altars stood against the wall, surrounded by wooden balustrades. On
      the left-hand one, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, was a large gilded
      plaster statue of the Mother of God, wearing a regal gold crown upon her
      chestnut hair; while on her left arm sat the Divine Child, nude and
      smiling, whose little hand raised the star-spangled orb of the universe.
      The Virgin&rsquo;s feet were poised on clouds, and beneath them peeped the heads
      of winged cherubs. Then the right-hand altar, used for the masses for the
      dead, was surmounted by a crucifix of painted papier-mache&mdash;a
      pendant, as it were, to the Virgin&rsquo;s effigy. The figure of Christ, as
      large as a child of ten years old, showed Him in all the horror of His
      death-throes, with head thrown back, ribs projecting, abdomen hollowed in,
      and limbs distorted and splashed with blood. There was a pulpit, too&mdash;a
      square box reached by a five-step block&mdash;near a clock with running
      weights, in a walnut case, whose thuds shook the whole church like the
      beatings of some huge heart concealed, it might be, under the stone flags.
      All along the nave the fourteen Stations of the Cross, fourteen coarsely
      coloured prints in narrow black frames, bespeckled the staring whiteness
      of the walls with the yellow, blue, and scarlet of scenes from the
      Passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Deo Gratias</i>,&rsquo; stuttered out Vincent at the end of the Epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of love, the immolation of the Holy Victim, was about to
      begin. The server took the Missal and bore it to the left, or Gospel-side,
      of the altar, taking care not to touch the pages of the book. Each time he
      passed before the tabernacle he made a genuflexion slantwise, which threw
      him all askew. Returning to the right-hand side once more, he stood
      upright with crossed arms during the reading of the Gospel. The priest,
      after making the sign of the cross upon the Missal, next crossed himself:
      first upon his forehead&mdash;to declare that he would never blush for the
      divine word; then on his mouth&mdash;to show his unchanging readiness to
      confess his faith; and finally on his heart&mdash;to mark that it belonged
      to God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Dominus vobiscum</i>,&rsquo; said he, turning round and facing the cold
      white church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Et cum spiritu tuo</i>,&rsquo; answered Vincent, who once more was on his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Offertory having been recited, the priest uncovered the chalice. For a
      moment he held before his breast the paten containing the host, which he
      offered up to God, for himself, for those present, and for all the
      faithful, living and dead. Then, slipping it on to the edge of the
      corporal without touching it with his fingers, he took up the chalice and
      carefully wiped it with the purificator. Vincent had in the meanwhile
      fetched the cruets from the credence table, and now presented them in
      turn, first the wine and then the water. The priest then offered up on
      behalf of the whole world the half-filled chalice, which he next replaced
      upon the corporal and covered with the pall. Then once again he prayed,
      and returned to the side of the altar where the server let a little water
      dribble over his thumbs and forefingers to purify him from the slightest
      sinful stain. When he had dried his hands on the finger-cloth, La Teuse&mdash;who
      stood there waiting&mdash;emptied the cruet-salver into a zinc pail at the
      corner of the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Orate, fratres</i>,&rsquo; resumed the priest aloud as he faced the empty
      benches, extending and reclasping his hands in a gesture of appeal to all
      men of good-will. And turning again towards the altar, he continued his
      prayer in a lower tone, while Vincent began to mutter a long Latin
      sentence in which he eventually got lost. Now it was that the yellow
      sunbeams began to dart through the windows; called, as it were, by the
      priest, the sun itself had come to mass, throwing golden sheets of light
      upon the left-hand wall, the confessional, the Virgin&rsquo;s altar, and the big
      clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle creak came from the confessional; the Mother of God, in a halo,
      in the dazzlement of her golden crown and mantle smiled tenderly with
      tinted lips upon the infant Jesus; and the heated clock throbbed out the
      time with quickening strokes. It seemed as if the sun peopled the benches
      with the dusty motes that danced in his beams, as if the little church,
      that whitened stable, were filled with a glowing throng. Without, were
      heard the sounds that told of the happy waking of the countryside, the
      blades of grass sighed out content, the damp leaves dried themselves in
      the warmth, the birds pruned their feathers and took a first flit round.
      And indeed the countryside itself seemed to enter with the sun; for beside
      one of the windows a large rowan tree shot up, thrusting some of its
      branches through the shattered panes and stretching out leafy buds as if
      to take a peep within; while through the fissures of the great door the
      weeds on the threshold threatened to encroach upon the nave. Amid all this
      quickening life, the big Christ, still in shadow, alone displayed signs of
      death, the sufferings of ochre-daubed and lake-bespattered flesh. A
      sparrow raised himself up for a moment at the edge of a hole, took a
      glance, then flew away; but only to reappear almost immediately when with
      noiseless wing he dropped between the benches before the Virgin&rsquo;s altar. A
      second sparrow followed; and soon from all the boughs of the rowan tree
      came others that calmly hopped about the flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth</i>,&rsquo; said the priest
      in a low tone, whilst slightly stooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vincent rang the little bell thrice; and the sparrows, scared by the
      sudden tinkling, flew off with such a mighty buzz of wings that La Teuse,
      who had just gone back into the sacristy, came out again, grumbling; &lsquo;The
      little rascals! they will mess everything. I&rsquo;ll bet that Mademoiselle
      Desiree has been here again to scatter bread-crumbs for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dread moment was at hand. The body and the blood of a God were about
      to descend upon the altar. The priest kissed the altar-cloth, clasped his
      hands, and multiplied signs of the cross over host and chalice. The
      prayers of the canon of the mass now fell from his lips in a very ecstasy
      of humility and gratitude. His attitude, his gestures, the inflections of
      his voice, all expressed his consciousness of his littleness, his emotion
      at being selected for so great a task. Vincent came and knelt beside him,
      lightly lifted the chasuble with his left hand, the bell ready in his
      right; and the priest, his elbows resting on the edge of the altar,
      holding the host with the thumbs and forefingers of both hands, pronounced
      over it the words of consecration: <i>Hoc est enim corpus meum</i>. Then
      having bowed the knee before it, he raised it slowly as high as his hands
      could reach, following it upwards with his eyes, while the kneeling server
      rang the bell thrice. Then he consecrated the wine&mdash;<i>Hic est enim
      calix</i>&mdash;leaning once more upon his elbows, bowing, raising the cup
      aloft, his right hand round the stem, his left holding its base, and his
      eyes following it aloft. Again the server rang the bell three times. The
      great mystery of the Redemption had once more been repeated, once more had
      the adorable Blood flowed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just you wait a bit,&rsquo; growled La Teuse, as she tried to scare away the
      sparrows with outstretched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sparrows were now fearless. They had come back even while the bell
      was ringing, and, unabashed, were fluttering about the benches. The
      repeated tinklings even roused them into liveliness, and they answered
      back with little chirps which crossed amid the Latin words of prayer, like
      the rippling laughs of free urchins. The sun warmed their plumage, the
      sweet poverty of the church captivated them. They felt at home there, as
      in some barn whose shutters had been left open, and screeched, fought, and
      squabbled over the crumbs they found upon the floor. One flew to perch
      himself on the smiling Virgin&rsquo;s golden veil; another, whose daring put the
      old servant in a towering rage, made a hasty reconnaissance of La Teuse&rsquo;s
      skirts. And at the altar, the priest, with every faculty absorbed, his
      eyes fixed upon the sacred host, his thumbs and forefingers joined, did
      not even hear this invasion of the warm May morning, this rising flood of
      sunlight, greenery and birds, which overflowed even to the foot of the
      Calvary where doomed nature was wrestling in the death-throes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Per omnia soecula soeculorum</i>,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo; answered Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Pater</i> ended, the priest, holding the host over the chalice,
      broke it in the centre. Detaching a particle from one of the halves, he
      dropped it into the precious blood, to symbolise the intimate union into
      which he was about to enter with God. He said the <i>Agnus Dei</i> aloud,
      softly recited the three prescribed prayers, and made his act of
      unworthiness, and then with his elbows resting on the altar, and with the
      paten beneath his chin, he partook of both portions of the host at once.
      After a fervent meditation, with his hands clasped before his face, he
      took the paten and gathered from the corporal the sacred particles of the
      host that had fallen, and dropped them into the chalice. One particle
      which had adhered to his thumb he removed with his forefinger. And,
      crossing himself, chalice in hand, with the paten once again below his
      chin, he drank all the precious blood in three draughts, never taking his
      lips from the cup&rsquo;s rim, but imbibing the divine Sacrifice to the last
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vincent had risen to fetch the cruets from the credence table. But
      suddenly the door of the passage leading to the parsonage flew open and
      swung back against the wall, to admit a handsome child-like girl of
      twenty-two, who carried something hidden in her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thirteen of them,&rsquo; she called out. &lsquo;All the eggs were good.&rsquo; And she
      opened out her apron and revealed a brood of little shivering chicks, with
      sprouting down and beady black eyes. &lsquo;Do just look,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t
      they sweet little pets, the darlings! Oh, look at the little white one
      climbing on the others&rsquo; backs! and the spotted one already flapping his
      tiny wings! The eggs were a splendid lot; not one of them unfertile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse, who was helping to serve the mass in spite of all prohibitions,
      and was at that very moment handing the cruets to Vincent for the
      ablutions, thereupon turned round and loudly exclaimed: &lsquo;Do be quiet,
      Mademoiselle Desiree! Don&rsquo;t you see we haven&rsquo;t finished yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open doorway now came the strong smell of a farmyard, blowing
      like some generative ferment into the church amidst the warm sunlight that
      was creeping over the altar. Desiree stood there for a moment delighted
      with the little ones she carried, watching Vincent pour, and her brother
      drink, the purifying wine, in order that nought of the sacred elements
      should be left within his mouth. And she stood there still when he came
      back to the side of the altar, holding the chalice in both hands, so that
      Vincent might pour over his forefingers and thumbs the wine and water of
      ablution, which he likewise drank. But when the mother hen ran up clucking
      with alarm to seek her little ones, and threatened to force her way into
      the church, Desiree went off, talking maternally to her chicks, while the
      priest, after pressing the purificator to his lips, wiped first the rim
      and next the interior of the chalice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the end, the act of thanksgiving to God. For the last time the
      server removed the Missal, and brought it back to the right-hand side. The
      priest replaced the purificator, paten, and pall upon the chalice; once
      more pinched the two large folds of the veil together, and laid upon it
      the burse containing the corporal. His whole being was now one act of
      ardent thanksgiving. He besought from Heaven the forgiveness of his sins,
      the grace of a holy life, and the reward of everlasting life. He remained
      as if overwhelmed by this miracle of love, the ever-recurring immolation,
      which sustained him day by day with the blood and flesh of his Savior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read the final prayers, he turned and said: &lsquo;<i>Ite, missa est</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Deo gratias</i>,&rsquo; answered Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having turned back to kiss the altar, the priest faced round anew, his
      left hand just below his breast, his right outstretched whilst blessing
      the church, which the gladsome sunbeams and noisy sparrows filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater et Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Amen</i>,&rsquo; said the server, as he crossed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had risen higher, and the sparrows were growing bolder. While the
      priest read from the left-hand altar-card the passage of the Gospel of St.
      John, announcing the eternity of the Word, the sunrays set the altar
      ablaze, whitened the panels of imitation marble, and dimmed the flame of
      the two candles, whose short wicks were now merely two dull spots. The
      victorious orb enveloped with his glory the crucifix, the candlesticks,
      the chasuble, the veil of the chalice&mdash;all the gold work that paled
      beneath his beams. And when at last the priest, after taking the chalice
      in his hands and making a genuflexion, covered his head and turned from
      the altar to follow the server, laden with the cruets and finger-cloth, to
      the sacristy, the planet remained sole master of the church. Its rays in
      turn now rested on the altar-cloth, irradiating the tabernacle-door with
      splendour, and celebrating the fertile powers of May. Warmth rose from the
      stone flags. The daubed walls, the tall Virgin, the huge Christ, too, all
      seemed to quiver as with shooting sap, as if death had been conquered by
      the earth&rsquo;s eternal youth.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Le Teuse hastily put out the candles, but lingered to make one last
      attempt to drive away the sparrows, and so when she returned to the
      sacristy with the Missal she no longer found Abbe Mouret there. Having
      washed his hands and put away the sacred vessels and vestments, he was now
      standing in the dining room, breakfasting off a cup of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You really ought to prevent your sister from scattering bread in the
      church,&rsquo; said La Teuse on coming in. &lsquo;It was last winter she hit upon that
      pretty prank. She said the sparrows were cold, and that God might well
      give them some food. You see, she&rsquo;ll end by making us sleep with all her
      fowls and rabbits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should be all the warmer,&rsquo; pleasantly replied the young priest. &lsquo;You
      are always grumbling, La Teuse. Do let our poor Desiree pet her animals.
      She has no other pleasure, poor innocent!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant took her stand in the centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do believe you yourself wouldn&rsquo;t mind a bit if the magpies actually
      built their nests in the church. You never can see anything, everything
      seems just what it ought to be to you. Your sister is precious lucky in
      having had you to take charge of her when you left the seminary. No
      father, no mother. I should like to know who would let her mess about as
      she does in a farmyard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then softening, she added in a gentler tone: &lsquo;To be sure, it would be a
      pity to cross her. She hasn&rsquo;t a touch of malice in her. She&rsquo;s like a child
      of ten, although she&rsquo;s one of the finest grown girls in the neighbourhood.
      And I have to put her to bed, as you know, every night, and send her to
      sleep with stories, just like a little child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret had remained standing, finishing the cup of milk he held
      between his fingers, which were slightly reddened by the chill atmosphere
      of the dining-room&mdash;a large room with painted grey walls, a floor of
      square tiles, and having no furniture beyond a table and a few chairs. La
      Teuse picked up a napkin which she had laid at a corner of the table in
      readiness for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t much linen you dirty,&rsquo; she muttered. &lsquo;One would think you could
      never sit down, that you are always just about to start off. Ah! if you
      had known Monsieur Caffin, the poor dead priest whose place you have
      taken! What a man he was for comfort! Why, he couldn&rsquo;t have digested his
      food, if he had eaten standing. A Norman he was, from Canteleu, like
      myself. I don&rsquo;t thank him, I tell you, for having brought me to such a
      wild-beast country as this. When first we came, O, Lord! how bored we
      were! But the poor priest had had some uncomfortable tales going about him
      at home.... Why, sir, didn&rsquo;t you sweeten your milk, then? Aren&rsquo;t those the
      two lumps of sugar?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest put down his cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I must have forgotten, I believe,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse stared at him and shrugged her shoulders. She folded up inside
      the napkin a slice of stale home-made bread which had also been left
      untouched on the table. Then just as the priest was about to go out, she
      ran after him and knelt down at his feet, exclaiming: &lsquo;Stop, your
      shoe-laces are not even fastened. I cannot imagine how your feet can stand
      those peasant shoes, you&rsquo;re such a little, tender man and look as if you
      had been preciously spoilt! Ah, the bishop must have known a deal about
      you, to go and give you the poorest living in the department.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it was I who chose Les Artaud,&rsquo; said the priest, breaking into
      another smile. &lsquo;You are very bad-tempered this morning, La Teuse. Are we
      not happy here? We have got all we want, and our life is as peaceful as if
      in paradise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She then restrained herself and laughed in her turn, saying: &lsquo;You are a
      holy man, Monsieur le Cure. But come and see what a splendid wash I have
      got. That will be better than squabbling with one another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was obliged to follow, for she might prevent him going out at
      all if he did not compliment her on her washing. As he left the
      dining-room he stumbled over a heap of rubbish in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, nothing,&rsquo; said La Teuse in her grimest tone. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only the parsonage
      coming down. However, you are quite content, you&rsquo;ve got all you want. Good
      heavens! there are holes and to spare. Just look at that ceiling, now.
      Isn&rsquo;t it cracked all over? If we don&rsquo;t get buried alive one of these days,
      we shall owe a precious big taper to our guardian angel. However, if it
      suits you&mdash;It&rsquo;s like the church. Those broken panes ought to have
      been replaced these two years. In winter our Lord gets frozen with the
      cold. Besides, it would keep out those rascally sparrows. I shall paste
      paper over the holes. You see if I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A capital idea,&rsquo; murmured the priest, &lsquo;they might very well be pasted
      over. As to the walls, they are stouter than we think. In my room, the
      floor has only given way slightly in front of the window. The house will
      see us all buried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the little open shed near the kitchen, in order to please La
      Teuse he went into ecstasies over the washing; he even had to dip his
      fingers into it and feel it. This so pleased the old woman that her
      attentions became quite motherly. She no longer scolded, but ran to fetch
      a clothes-brush, saying: &lsquo;You surely are not going out with yesterday&rsquo;s
      mud on your cassock! If you had left it out on the banister, it would be
      clean now&mdash;it&rsquo;s still a good one. But do lift it up well when you
      cross any field. The thistles tear everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking she kept turning him round like a child, shaking him from
      head to foot with her energetic brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there, that will do,&rsquo; he said, escaping from her at last. &lsquo;Take
      care of Desiree, won&rsquo;t you? I will tell her I am going out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this minute a fresh clear voice called to him: &lsquo;Serge! Serge!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree came flying up, her cheeks ruddy with glee, her head bare, her
      black locks twisted tightly upon her neck, and her hands and arms
      smothered up to the elbows with manure. She had been cleaning out her
      poultry house. When she caught sight of her brother just about to go out
      with his breviary under his arm, she laughed aloud, and kissed him on his
      mouth, with her arms thrown back behind her to avoid soiling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she hurriedly exclaimed, &lsquo;I should dirty you. Oh! I am having
      such fun! You must see the animals when you come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she fled away again. Abbe Mouret then said that he would be back
      about eleven for luncheon, and as he started, La Teuse, who had followed
      him to the doorstep, shouted after him her last injunctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to see Brother Archangias. And look in also at the
      Brichets&rsquo;; the wife came again yesterday about that wedding. Just listen,
      Monsieur le Cure! I met their Rosalie. She&rsquo;d ask nothing better than to
      marry big Fortune. Have a talk with old Bambousse; perhaps he will listen
      to you now. And don&rsquo;t come back at twelve o&rsquo;clock, like the other day.
      Come, say you&rsquo;ll be back at eleven, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the priest turned round no more. So she went in again, growling
      between her teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When does he ever listen to me? Barely twenty-six years old and does just
      as he likes. To be sure, he&rsquo;s an old man of sixty for holiness; but then
      he has never known life; he knows nothing, it&rsquo;s no trouble to him to be as
      good as a cherub!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Abbe Mouret had got beyond all hearing of La Teuse he stopped,
      thankful to be alone at last. The church was built on a hillock, which
      sloped down gently to the village. With its large gaping windows and
      bright red tiles, it stretched out like a deserted sheep-cote. The priest
      turned round and glanced at the parsonage, a greyish building springing
      from the very side of the church; but as if fearful that he might again be
      overtaken by the interminable chatter that had been buzzing in his ears
      ever since morning, he turned up to the right again, and only felt safe
      when he at last stood before the great doorway, where he could not be seen
      from the parsonage. The front of the church, quite bare and worn by the
      sunshine and rain of years, was crowned by a narrow open stone belfry, in
      which a small bell showed its black silhouette, whilst its rope
      disappeared through the tiles. Six broken steps, on one side half buried
      in the earth, led up to the lofty arched door, now cracked, smothered with
      dust and rust and cobwebs, and so frailly hung upon its outwrenched hinges
      that it seemed as if the first slight puff would secure free entrance to
      the winds of heaven. Abbe Mouret, who had an affection for this
      dilapidated door, leaned against one of its leaves as he stood upon the
      steps. Thence he could survey the whole country round at a glance. And
      shading his eyes with his hands he scanned the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of May exuberant vegetation burst forth from that stony soil.
      Gigantic lavenders, juniper bushes, patches of rank herbage swarmed over
      the church threshold, and scattered clumps of dark greenery even to the
      very tiles. It seemed as if the first throb of shooting sap in the tough
      matted underwood might well topple the church over. At that early hour,
      amid all the travail of nature&rsquo;s growth, there was a hum of vivifying
      warmth, and the very rocks quivered as with a long and silent effort. But
      the Abbe failed to comprehend the ardour of nature&rsquo;s painful labour; he
      simply thought that the steps were tottering, and thereupon leant against
      the other side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countryside stretched away for a distance of six miles, bounded by a
      wall of tawny hills speckled with black pine-woods. It was a fearful
      landscape of arid wastes and rocky spurs rending the soil. The few patches
      of arable ground were like scattered pools of blood, red fields with rows
      of lean almond trees, grey-topped olive trees and long lines of vines,
      streaking the soil with their brown stems. It was as if some huge
      conflagration had swept by there, scattering the ashes of forests over the
      hill-tops, consuming all the grass of the meadow lands, and leaving its
      glare and furnace-like heat behind in the hollows. Only here and there was
      the softer note of a pale green patch of growing corn. The landscape
      generally was wild, lacking even a threadlet of water, dying of thirst,
      and flying away in clouds of dust at the least breath of wind. But at the
      farthest point where the crumbling hills on the horizon had left a breach
      one espied some distant fresh moist greenery, a stretch of the
      neighbouring valley fertilised by the Viorne, a river flowing down from
      the gorges of the Seille.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest lowered his dazzled glance upon the village, whose few
      scattered houses straggled away below the church&mdash;wretched hovels
      they were of rubble and boards strewn along a narrow path without sign of
      streets. There were about thirty of them altogether, some squatting amidst
      muck-heaps, and black with woeful want; others roomier and more
      cheerful-looking with their roofs of pinkish tiles. Strips of garden,
      victoriously planted amidst stony soil, displayed plots of vegetables
      enclosed by quickset hedges. At this hour Les Artaud was empty, not a
      woman was at the windows, not a child was wallowing in the dust; parties
      of fowls alone went to and fro, ferreting among the straw, seeking food up
      to the very thresholds of the houses, whose open doors gaped in the
      sunlight. A big black dog seated on his haunches at the entrance to the
      village seemed to be mounting guard over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languor slowly stole over Abbe Mouret. The rising sun steeped him in such
      warmth that he leant back against the church door pervaded by a feeling of
      happy restfulness. His thoughts were dwelling on that hamlet of Les
      Artaud, which had sprung up there among the stones like one of the knotty
      growths of the valley. All its inhabitants were related, all bore the same
      name, so that from their very cradle they were distinguished among
      themselves by nicknames. An Artaud, their ancestor, had come hither and
      settled like a pariah in this waste. His family had grown with all the
      wild vitality of the herbage that sucked life from the rocky boulders. It
      had at last become a tribe, a rural community, in which cousin-ships were
      lost in the mists of centuries. They intermarried with shameless
      promiscuity. Not an instance could be cited of any Artaud taking himself a
      wife from any neighbouring village; only some of the girls occasionally
      went elsewhere. The others were born and died fixed to that spot,
      leisurely increasing and multiplying on their dunghills with the
      irreflectiveness of trees, and with no definite notion of the world that
      lay beyond the tawny rocks, in whose midst they vegetated. And yet there
      were already rich and poor among them; fowls having at times disappeared,
      the fowl-houses were now closed at night with stout padlocks; moreover one
      Artaud had killed another Artaud one evening behind the mill. These folk,
      begirt by that belt of desolate hills, were truly a people apart&mdash;a
      race sprung from the soil, a miniature replica of mankind, three hundred
      souls all told, beginning the centuries yet once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the priest the sombre shadows of seminary life still hovered. For
      years he had never seen the sun. He perceived it not even now, his eyes
      closed and gazing inwards on his soul, and with no feeling for perishable
      nature, fated to damnation, save contempt. For a long time in his hours of
      devout thought he had dreamt of some hermit&rsquo;s desert, of some mountain
      hole, where no living thing&mdash;neither being, plant, nor water&mdash;should
      distract him from the contemplation of God. It was an impulse springing
      from the purest love, from a loathing of all physical sensation. There,
      dying to self, and with his back turned to the light of day, he would have
      waited till he should cease to be, till nothing should remain of him but
      the sovereign whiteness of the soul. To him heaven seemed all white, with
      a luminous whiteness as if lilies there snowed down upon one, as if every
      form of purity, innocence, and chastity there blazed. But his confessor
      reproved him whenever he related his longings for solitude, his cravings
      for an existence of Godlike purity; and recalled him to the struggles of
      the Church, the necessary duties of the priesthood. Later on, after his
      ordination, the young priest had come to Les Artaud at his own request,
      there hoping to realise his dream of human annihilation. In that desolate
      spot, on that barren soil, he might shut his ears to all worldly sounds,
      and live the dreamy life of a saint. For some months past, in truth, his
      existence had been wholly undisturbed, rarely had any thrill of the
      village-life disturbed him; and even the sun&rsquo;s heat scarcely brought him
      any glow of feeling as he walked the paths, his whole being wrapped in
      heaven, heedless of the unceasing travail of life amidst which he moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big black dog watching over Les Artaud had determined to come up to
      Abbe Mouret, and now sat upon its haunches at the priest&rsquo;s feet; but the
      unconscious man remained absorbed amidst the sweetness of the morning. On
      the previous evening he had begun the exercises of the Rosary, and to the
      intercession of the Virgin with her Divine Son he attributed the great joy
      which filled his soul. How despicable appeared all the good things of the
      earth! How thankfully he recognised his poverty! When he entered into holy
      orders, after losing on the same day both his father and his mother
      through a tragedy the fearful details of which were even now unknown to
      him,* he had relinquished all his share of their property to an elder
      brother. His only remaining link with the world was his sister; he had
      undertaken the care of her, stirred by a kind of religious affection for
      her feeble intelligence. The dear innocent was so childish, such a very
      little girl, that she recalled to him the poor in spirit to whom the
      Gospel promises the kingdom of heaven. Of late, however, she had somewhat
      disturbed him; she was growing too lusty, too full of health and life. But
      his discomfort was yet of the slightest. His days were spent in that inner
      life he had created for himself, for which he had relinquished all else.
      He closed the portals of his senses, and sought to free himself from all
      bodily needs, so that he might be but a soul enrapt in contemplation. To
      him nature offered only snares and abominations; he gloried in maltreating
      her, in despising her, in releasing himself from his human slime. And as
      the just man must be a fool according to the world, he considered himself
      an exile on this earth; his thoughts were solely fixed upon the favours of
      Heaven, incapable as he was of understanding how an eternity of bliss
      could be weighed against a few hours of perishable enjoyment. His reason
      duped him and his senses lied; and if he advanced in virtue it was
      particularly by humility and obedience. His wish was to be the last of
      all, one subject to all, in order that the divine dew might fall upon his
      heart as upon arid sand; he considered himself overwhelmed with reproach
      and with confusion, unworthy of ever being saved from sin. He no longer
      belonged to himself&mdash;blind, deaf, dead to the world as he was. He was
      God&rsquo;s thing. And from the depth of the abjectness to which he sought to
      plunge, Hosannahs suddenly bore him aloft, above the happy and the mighty
      into the splendour of never-ending bliss.

    <p>
      Thus, at Les Artaud, Abbe Mouret had once more experienced, each time he
      read the &lsquo;Imitation,&rsquo; the raptures of the cloistered life which he had
      longed for at one time so ardently. As yet he had not had to fight any
      battle. From the moment that he knelt down, he became perfect, absolutely
      oblivious of the flesh, unresisting, undisturbed, as if overpowered by the
      Divine grace. Such ecstasy at God&rsquo;s approach is well known to some young
      priests: it is a blissful moment when all is hushed, and the only desire
      is but a boundless craving for purity. From no human creature had he
      sought his consolations. He who believes a certain thing to be all in all
      cannot be troubled: and he did believe that God was all in all, and that
      humility, obedience, and chastity were everything. He could remember
      having heard temptation spoken of as an abominable torture that tries the
      holiest. But he would only smile: God had never left him. He bore his
      faith about him thus like a breast-plate protecting him from the slightest
      breath of evil. He could recall how he had hidden himself and wept for
      very love; he knew not whom he loved, but he wept for love, for love of
      some one afar off. The recollection never failed to move him. Later on he
      had decided on becoming a priest in order to satisfy that craving for a
      superhuman affection which was his sole torment. He could not see where
      greater love could be. In that state of life he satisfied his being, his
      inherited predisposition, his youthful dreams, his first virile desires.
      If temptation must come, he awaited it with the calmness of the seminarist
      ignorant of the world. He felt that his manhood had been killed in him: it
      gladdened him to feel himself a creature set apart, unsexed, turned from
      the usual paths of life, and, as became a lamb of the Lord, marked with
      the tonsure.

    <p>
      While the priest pondered the sun was heating the big church-door. Gilded
      flies buzzed round a large flower that was blooming between two of the
      church-door steps. Abbe Mouret, feeling slightly dazed, was at last about
      to move away, when the big black dog sprang, barking violently, towards
      the iron gate of the little graveyard on the left of the church. At the
      same time a harsh voice called out: &lsquo;Ah! you young rascal! So you stop
      away from school, and I find you in the graveyard! Oh, don&rsquo;t say no: I
      have been watching you this quarter of an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the priest stepped forward he saw Vincent, whom a Brother of the
      Christian Schools was clutching tightly by the ear. The lad was suspended,
      as it were, over a ravine skirting the graveyard, at the bottom of which
      flowed the Mascle, a mountain torrent whose crystal waters plunged into
      the Viorne, six miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother Archangias!&rsquo; softly called the priest, as if to appease the
      fearful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother, however, did not release the boy&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Monsieur le Cure?&rsquo; he growled. &lsquo;Just fancy, this rascal is
      always poking his nose into the graveyard. I don&rsquo;t know what he can be up
      to here. I ought to let go of him and let him smash his skull down there.
      It would be what he deserves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad remained dumb, with his cunning eyes tight shut as he clung to the
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, Brother Archangias,&rsquo; continued the priest, &lsquo;he might slip.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he himself helped Vincent to scramble up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, my young friend, what were you doing there?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;You must
      not go playing in graveyards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad had opened his eyes, and crept away, fearfully, from the Brother,
      to place himself under the priest&rsquo;s protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; he said in a low voice, as he raised his bushy head.
      &lsquo;There is a tomtit&rsquo;s nest in the brambles there, under that rock. For over
      ten days I&rsquo;ve been watching it, and now the little ones are hatched, so I
      came this morning after serving your mass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A tomtit&rsquo;s nest!&rsquo; exclaimed Brother Archangias. &lsquo;Wait a bit! wait a bit!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he stepped aside, picked a clod of earth off a grave and flung
      it into the brambles. But he missed the nest. Another clod, however, more
      skilfully thrown upset the frail cradle, and precipitated the fledglings
      into the torrent below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, perhaps,&rsquo; he continued, clapping his hands to shake off the earth
      that soiled them, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t come roaming here any more, like a heathen;
      the dead will pull your feet at night if you go walking over them again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vincent, who had laughed at seeing the nest dive into the stream, looked
      round him and shrugged his shoulders like one of strong mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Dead folk don&rsquo;t stir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The graveyard, in truth, was not a place to inspire fear. It was a barren
      piece of ground whose narrow paths were smothered by rank weeds. Here and
      there the soil was bossy with mounds. A single tombstone, that of Abbe
      Caffin, brand-new and upright, could be perceived in the centre of the
      ground. Save this, all around there were only broken fragments of crosses,
      withered tufts of box, and old slabs split and moss-eaten. There were not
      two burials a year. Death seemed to make no dwelling in that waste spot,
      whither La Teuse came every evening to fill her apron with grass for
      Desiree&rsquo;s rabbits. A gigantic cypress tree, standing near the gate, alone
      cast shadow upon the desert field. This cypress, a landmark visible for
      nine miles around, was known to the whole countryside as the Solitaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s full of lizards,&rsquo; added Vincent, looking at the cracks of the
      church-wall. &lsquo;One could have a fine lark&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he sprang out with a bound on seeing the Brother lift his foot. The
      latter proceeded to call the priest&rsquo;s attention to the dilapidated state
      of the gate, which was not only eaten up with rust, but had one hinge off,
      and the lock broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ought to be repaired,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret smiled, but made no reply. Addressing Vincent, who was romping
      with the dog: &lsquo;I say, my boy,&rsquo; he asked, &lsquo;do you know where old Bambousse
      is at work this morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad glanced towards the horizon. &lsquo;He must be at his Olivettes field
      now,&rsquo; he answered, pointing towards the left. &lsquo;But Voriau will show your
      reverence the way. He&rsquo;s sure to know where his master is.&rsquo; And he clapped
      his hands and called: &lsquo;Hie! Voriau! hie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The big black dog paused a moment, wagging his tail, and seeking to read
      the urchin&rsquo;s eyes. Then, barking joyfully, he set off down the slope to
      the village. Abbe Mouret and Brother Archangias followed him, chatting. A
      hundred yards further Vincent surreptitiously bolted, and again glided up
      towards the church, keeping a watchful eye upon them, and ready to dart
      behind a bush if they should look round. With adder-like suppleness, he
      once more glided into the graveyard, that paradise full of lizards, nests,
      and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, while Voriau led the way before them along the dusty road,
      Brother Archangias was angrily saying to the priest: &lsquo;Let be! Monsieur le
      Cure, they&rsquo;re spawn of damnation, those toads are! They ought to have
      their backs broken, to make them pleasing to God. They grow up in
      irreligion, like their fathers. Fifteen years have I been here, and not
      one Christian have I been able to turn out. The minute they quit my hands,
      good-bye! They think of nothing but their land, their vines, their
      olive-trees. Not one ever sets foot in church. Brute beasts they are,
      struggling with their stony fields! Guide them with the stick, Monsieur le
      Cure, yes, the stick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after drawing breath, he added with a terrific wave of his hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those Artauds, look you, are like the brambles over-running these rocks.
      One stem has been enough to poison the whole district. They cling on, they
      multiply, they live in spite of everything. Nothing short of fire from
      heaven, as at Gomorrha, will clear it all away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should never despair of sinners,&rsquo; said Abbe Mouret, all inward
      peacefulness, as he leisurely walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But these are the devil&rsquo;s own,&rsquo; broke in the Brother still more
      violently. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a peasant, too. Up to eighteen I dug the earth; and
      later on, when I was at the Training College, I had to sweep, pare
      vegetables, do all the heavy work. It&rsquo;s not their toilsome labour I find
      fault with. On the contrary, for God prefers the lowly. But the Artauds
      live like beasts! They are like their dogs, they never attend mass, and
      make a mock of the commandments of God and of the Church. They think of
      nothing but their plots of lands, so sweet they are on them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Voriau, his tail wagging, kept stopping and moving on again as soon as he
      saw that they still followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There certainly are some grievous things going on,&rsquo; said Abbe Mouret. &lsquo;My
      predecessor, Abbe Caffin&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A poor specimen,&rsquo; interrupted the Brother. &lsquo;He came here to us from
      Normandy owing to some disreputable affair. Once here, his sole thought
      was good living; he let everything go to rack and ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, Abbe Caffin certainly did what he could; but I must own that his
      efforts were all but barren in results. My own are mostly fruitless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias shrugged his shoulders. He walked on for a minute in
      silence, swaying his tall bony frame, which looked as if it had been
      roughly fashioned with a hatchet. The sun beat down upon his neck,
      shadowing his hard, sword-edged peasant&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;I am too much beneath
      you to lecture you; but still, I am almost double your age, I know this
      part, and therefore I feel justified in telling you that you will gain
      nothing by gentleness. The catechism, understand, is enough. God has no
      mercy on the wicked. He burns them. Stick to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Abbe Mouret, whose head remained bowed, did not open his mouth,
      he went on: &lsquo;Religion is leaving the country districts because it is made
      over indulgent. It was respected when it spoke out like an unforgiving
      mistress. I really don&rsquo;t know what they can teach you now in the
      seminaries. The new priests weep like children with their parishioners.
      God no longer seems the same. I dare say, Monsieur le Cure, that you don&rsquo;t
      even know your catechism by heart now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the priest, wounded by the imperiousness with which the Brother so
      roughly sought to dominate him, looked up and dryly rejoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will do, your zeal is very praiseworthy. But haven&rsquo;t you something
      to tell me? You came to the parsonage this morning, did you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Brother Archangias plumply answered: &lsquo;I had to tell you just
      what I have told you. The Artauds live like pigs. Only yesterday I learned
      that Rosalie, old Bambousse&rsquo;s eldest daughter, is in the family way. It
      happens with all of them before they get married. And they simply laugh at
      reproaches, as you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; murmured Abbe Mouret, &lsquo;it is a great scandal. I am just on my way
      to see old Bambousse to speak to him about it; it is desirable that they
      should be married as soon as possible. The child&rsquo;s father, it seems, is
      Fortune, the Brichets&rsquo; eldest son. Unfortunately the Brichets are poor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That Rosalie, now,&rsquo; continued the Brother, &lsquo;is just eighteen. Not four
      years since I still had her under me at school, and she was already a
      gadabout. I have now got her sister Catherine, a chit of eleven, who seems
      likely to become even worse than her elder. One comes across her in every
      corner with that little scamp, Vincent. It&rsquo;s no good, you may pull their
      ears till they bleed, the woman always crops up in them. They carry
      perdition about with them and are only fit to be thrown on a muck-heap.
      What a splendid riddance if all girls were strangled at their birth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His loathing, his hatred of woman made him swear like a carter. Abbe
      Mouret, who had been listening to him with unmoved countenance, smiled at
      last at his rabid utterances. He called Voriau, who had strayed into a
      field close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, look there!&rsquo; cried Brother Archangias, pointing to a group of
      children playing at the bottom of a ravine, &lsquo;there are my young devils,
      who play the truant under pretence of going to help their parents among
      the vines! You may be certain that jade of a Catherine is among them....
      There, didn&rsquo;t I tell you! Till to-night, Monsieur le Cure. Oh, just you
      wait, you rascals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Off he went at a run, his dirty neckband flying over his shoulder, and his
      big greasy cassock tearing up the thistles. Abbe Mouret watched him swoop
      down into the midst of the children, who scattered like frightened
      sparrows. But he succeeded in seizing Catherine and one boy by the ears
      and led them back towards the village, clutching them tightly with his big
      hairy fingers, and overwhelming them with abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest walked on again. Brother Archangias sometimes aroused strange
      scruples in his mind. With his vulgarity and coarseness the Brother seemed
      to him the true man of God, free from earthly ties, submissive in all to
      Heaven&rsquo;s will, humble, blunt, ready to shower abuse upon sin. He, the
      priest, would then feel despair at his inability to rid himself more
      completely of his body; he regretted that he was not ugly, unclean,
      covered with vermin like some of the saints. Whenever the Brother had
      wounded him by some words of excessive coarseness, or by some over-hasty
      churlishness, he would blame himself for his refinement, his innate
      shrinking, as if these were really faults. Ought he not to be dead to all
      the weaknesses of this world? And this time also he smiled sadly as he
      thought how near he had been to losing his temper at the Brother&rsquo;s roughly
      put lesson. It was pride, it seemed to him, seeking to work his perdition
      by making him despise the lowly. However, in spite of himself, he felt
      relieved at being alone again, at being able to walk on gently, reading
      his breviary, free at last from the grating voice that had disturbed his
      dream of heavenly love.

      The road wound on between fallen rocks, among which the peasants had
      succeeded here and there in reclaiming six or seven yards of chalky soil,
      planted with old olive trees. Under the priest&rsquo;s feet the dust in the deep
      ruts crackled lightly like snow. At times, as he felt a warmer puff upon
      his face, he would raise his eyes from his book, as if to seek whence came
      this soft caress; but his gaze was vacant, straying without perception
      over the glowing horizon, over the twisted outlines of that
      passion-breathing landscape as it stretched out in the sun before him,
      dry, barren, despairing of the fertilisation for which it longed. And he
      would lower his hat over his forehead to protect himself against the warm
      breeze and tranquilly resume his reading, his cassock raising behind him a
      cloudlet of dust which rolled along the surface of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; a passing peasant said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds of digging alongside the cultivated strips of ground again roused
      him from his abstraction. He turned his head and perceived big
      knotty-limbed old men greeting him from among the vines. The Artauds were
      eagerly satisfying their passion for the soil, in the sun&rsquo;s full blaze.
      Sweating brows appeared from behind the bushes, heaving chests were slowly
      raised, the whole scene was one of ardent fructification, through which he
      moved with the calm step born of ignorance. No discomfort came to him from
      the great travail of love that permeated that splendid morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady! Voriau, you mustn&rsquo;t eat people!&rsquo; some one gaily shouted in a
      powerful voice by way of silencing the dog&rsquo;s loud barks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s you. Fortune?&rsquo; he said, approaching the edge of the field in
      which the young peasant was at work. &lsquo;I was just on my way to speak to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune was of the same age as the priest: a bigly built, bold-looking
      young fellow, with skin already hardened. He was clearing a small plot of
      stony heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about, Monsieur le Cure?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About Rosalie and you,&rsquo; replied the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune began to laugh. Perhaps he thought it droll that a priest should
      interest himself in such a matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not to blame in it nor she either. So much the
      worse if old Bambousse refuses to let me have her. You saw yourself how
      his dog was trying to bite me just now; he sets him on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Abbe Mouret was about to continue, old Artaud, called Brichet,
      whom he had not previously perceived, emerged from the shadow of a bush
      behind which he and his wife were eating. He was a little man, withered by
      age, with a cringing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your reverence must have been told a pack of lies,&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;The
      youngster is quite ready to marry Rosalie. What&rsquo;s happened isn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s
      fault. It has happened to others who got on all right just the same. The
      matter doesn&rsquo;t rest with us. You ought to speak to Bambousse. He&rsquo;s the one
      who looks down on us because he&rsquo;s got money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we are very poor,&rsquo; whined his wife, a tall lachrymose woman, who
      also rose to her feet. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve only this scrap of ground where the very
      devil seems to have been hailing stones. Not a bite of bread from it,
      even. Without you, your reverence, life would be impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brichet&rsquo;s wife was the one solitary devotee of the village. Whenever she
      had been to communion, she would hang about the parsonage, well knowing
      that La Teuse always kept a couple of loaves for her from her last baking.
      At times she was even able to carry off a rabbit or a fowl given her by
      Desiree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no end to the scandals,&rsquo; continued the priest. &lsquo;The marriage must
      take place without delay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! at once! as soon as the others are agreeable,&rsquo; said the old woman,
      alarmed about her periodical presents. &lsquo;What do you say, Brichet? we are
      not such bad Christians as to go against his reverence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune sniggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m quite ready,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and so is Rosalie. I saw her yesterday at
      the back of the mill. We haven&rsquo;t quarrelled. We stopped there to have a
      bit of a laugh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abbe Mouret interrupted him: &lsquo;Very well, I am now going to speak to
      Bambousse. He is over there, at Les Olivettes, I believe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was going off when the mother asked him what had become of her
      younger son Vincent, who had left in the early morning to serve mass.
      There was a lad now who badly needed his reverence&rsquo;s admonitions. And she
      walked by the priest&rsquo;s side for another hundred yards, bemoaning her
      poverty, the failure of the potato crop, the frost which had nipped the
      olive trees, the hot weather which threatened to scorch up the scanty
      corn. Then, as she left him, she solemnly declared that her son Fortune
      always said his prayers, both morning and evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voriau now ran on in front, and suddenly, at a turn in the road, he bolted
      across the fields. The priest then struck into a small path leading up a
      low hill. He was now at Les Olivettes, the most fertile spot in the
      neighbourhood, where the mayor of the commune, Artaud, otherwise
      Bambousse, owned several fields of corn, olive plantations, and vines. The
      dog was now romping round the skirts of a tall brunette, who burst into a
      loud laugh as she caught sight of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your father here, Rosalie?&rsquo; the latter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, just across there,&rsquo; she said, pointing with her hand and still
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the part of the field she had been weeding, she walked on before
      him with the vigorous springiness of a hard-working woman, her head
      unshielded from the sun, her neck all sunburnt, her hair black and coarse
      like a horse&rsquo;s mane. Her green-stained hands exhaled the odour of the
      weeds she had been pulling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she called out, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s Monsieur le Cure asking for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And there she remained, bold, unblushing, with a sly smile still hovering
      over her features. Bambousse, a stout, sweating, round-faced man, left his
      work and gaily came towards the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d take my oath you are going to speak to me about the repairs of the
      church,&rsquo; he exclaimed, as he clapped his earthy hands. &lsquo;Well, then,
      Monsieur le Cure, I can only say no, it&rsquo;s impossible. The commune hasn&rsquo;t
      got the coin. If the Lord provides plaster and tiles, we&rsquo;ll provide the
      workmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this jest of his the unbelieving peasant burst into a loud guffaw,
      slapped his thighs, coughed, and almost choked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not for the church I came,&rsquo; replied the Abbe Mouret. &lsquo;I wanted to
      speak to you about your daughter Rosalie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rosalie? What has she done to you, then?&rsquo; inquired Bambousse, his eyes
      blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was boldly staring at the young priest, scrutinising his white
      hands and slender, feminine neck, as if trying to make him redden. He,
      however, bluntly and with unruffled countenance, as if speaking of
      something quite indifferent, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what I mean, Bambousse. She must get married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rsquo; muttered the old man, with a bantering look. &lsquo;Many
      thanks for the message. The Brichets sent you, didn&rsquo;t they? Mother Brichet
      goes to mass, and so you give her a helping hand to marry her son&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      all very fine. But, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with that. It doesn&rsquo;t suit me.
      That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the astonished priest represented to him that the scandal must
      be stopped, and that he ought to forgive Fortune, as the latter was
      willing to make reparation for his transgression, and that, lastly, his
      daughter&rsquo;s reputation demanded a speedy marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ta, ta, ta,&rsquo; replied Bambousse, what a lot of words! I shall keep my
      daughter, please understand it. All that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with me. That
      Fortune is a beggarly pauper, without a brass farthing. What an easy job,
      if one could marry a girl like that! At that rate we should have all the
      young things marrying off morning and night. Thank Heaven! I&rsquo;m not worried
      about Rosalie: everybody knows what has happened; but it makes no
      difference. She can marry any one she chooses in the neighbourhood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the child?&rsquo; interrupted the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child indeed! There&rsquo;ll be time enough to think of that when it&rsquo;s
      born.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie, perceiving the turn the priest&rsquo;s application was taking, now
      thought it proper to ram her fists into her eyes and whimper. And she even
      let herself fall upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut up, will you, you hussy!&rsquo; howled her father in a rage. And he
      proceeded to revile her in the coarsest terms, which made her laugh
      silently behind her clenched fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t shut up? won&rsquo;t you? Just wait a minute then, you jade!&rsquo; 
      continued old Bambousse. And thereupon he picked up a clod of earth and
      flung it at her. It burst upon her knot of hair, crumbling down her neck
      and smothering her in dust. Dizzy from the blow, she bounded to her feet
      and fled, sheltering her head between her hands. But Bambousse had time to
      fling two more clods at her, and if the first only grazed her left
      shoulder, the next caught her full on the base of the spine, with such
      force that she fell upon her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bambousse!&rsquo; cried the priest, as he wrenched from the peasant&rsquo;s hand a
      number of stones which he had just picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let be, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;It was only soft earth. I
      ought to have thrown these stones at her. It&rsquo;s easy to see that you don&rsquo;t
      know girls. Hard as nails, all of them. I might duck that one in the well,
      I might break all her bones with a cudgel, and she&rsquo;d still be just the
      same. But I&rsquo;ve got my eye on her, and if I catch her!... Ah! well, they
      are all like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was already comforted. He took a good pull at a big flat bottle of
      wine, encased in wicker-work, which lay warming on the hot ground. And
      breaking once more into a laugh, he said: &lsquo;If I only had a glass, Monsieur
      le Cure, I would offer you some with pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So then,&rsquo; again asked the priest, &lsquo;this marriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be; I should get laughed at. Rosalie is a stout wench. She&rsquo;s
      worth a man to me. I shall have to hire a lad the day she goes off.... We
      can have another talk about it after the vintage. Besides, I don&rsquo;t want to
      be robbed. Give and take, say I. That&rsquo;s fair. What do you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless for another long half-hour did the priest remain there
      preaching to Bambousse, speaking to him of God, and plying him with all
      the reasons suited to the circumstances. But the old man had resumed his
      work; he shrugged his shoulders, jested, and grew more and more obstinate.
      At last, he broke out: &lsquo;But if you asked me for a sack of corn, you would
      give me money, wouldn&rsquo;t you? So why do you want me to let my daughter go
      for nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Much discomfited, Abbe Mouret left him. As he went down the path he saw
      Rosalie rolling about under an olive tree with Voriau, who was licking her
      face. With her arms whirling, she kept on repeating: &lsquo;You tickle me, you
      big stupid. Leave off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she perceived the priest, she made an attempt at a blush, settled her
      clothes, and once more raised her fists to her eyes. He, on his part,
      sought to console her by promising to attempt some fresh efforts with her
      father, adding that, in the meantime, she should do nothing to aggravate
      her sin. And then, as she impudently smiled at him, he pictured hell,
      where wicked women burn in torment. And afterwards he left her, his duty
      done, his soul once more full of the serenity which enabled him to pass
      undisturbed athwart the corruptions of the world.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning was becoming terribly hot. In that huge rocky amphitheatre the
      sun kindled a furnace-like glare from the moment when the first fine
      weather began. By the planet&rsquo;s height in the sky Abbe Mouret now perceived
      that he had only just time to return home if he wished to get there by
      eleven o&rsquo;clock and escape a scolding from La Teuse. Having finished
      reading his breviary and made his application to Bambousse, he swiftly
      retraced his steps, gazing as he went at his church, now a grey spot in
      the distance, and at the black rigid silhouette which the big
      cypress-tree, the Solitaire, set against the blue sky. Amidst the
      drowsiness fostered by the heat, he thought of how richly that evening he
      might decorate the Lady chapel for the devotions of the month of Mary.
      Before him the road offered a carpet of dust, soft to the tread and of
      dazzling whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Croix-Verte, as the Abbe was about to cross the highway leading
      from Plassans to La Palud, a gig coming down the hill compelled him to
      step behind a heap of stones. Then, as he crossed the open space, a voice
      called to him: &lsquo;Hallo, Serge, my boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig had pulled up and from it a man leant over. The priest recognised
      him&mdash;he was an uncle of his, Doctor Pascal Rougon, or Monsieur
      Pascal, as the poor folk of Plassans, whom he attended for nothing,
      briefly styled him. Although barely over fifty, he was already snowy
      white, with a big beard and abundant hair, amidst which his handsome
      regular features took an expression of shrewdness and benevolence.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * See M. Zola&rsquo;s novels, <i>Dr. Pascal</i> and <i>The Fortune of the
    Rougons</i>.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you potter about in the dust at this hour of the day?&rsquo; he said gaily,
      as he stooped to grasp the Abbe&rsquo;s hands. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of sunstroke?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more than you are, uncle,&rsquo; answered the priest, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I have the hood of my trap to shield me. Besides, sick folks won&rsquo;t
      wait. People die at all times, my boy.&rsquo; And he went on to relate that he
      was now on his way to old Jeanbernat, the steward of the Paradou, who had
      had an apoplectic stroke the night before. A neighbour, a peasant on his
      way to Plassans market, had summoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be dead by this time,&rsquo; the doctor continued. &lsquo;However, we must
      make sure.... Those old demons are jolly tough, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was already raising his whip, when Abbe Mouret stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay! what o&rsquo;clock do you make it, uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A quarter to eleven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe hesitated; he already seemed to hear La Teuse&rsquo;s terrible voice
      bawling in his ears that his luncheon was getting cold. But he plucked up
      courage and added swiftly: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, uncle. The unhappy man may
      wish to reconcile himself to God in his last hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Pascal could not restrain a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, Jeanbernat!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;ah, well! if ever you convert him! Never
      mind, come all the same. The sight of you is enough to cure him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest got in. The doctor, apparently regretting his jest, displayed
      an affectionate warmth of manner, whilst from time to time clucking his
      tongue by way of encouraging his horse. And out of the corner of his eye
      he inquisitively observed his nephew with the keenness of a scientist bent
      on taking notes. In short kindly sentences he inquired about his life, his
      habits, and the peaceful happiness he enjoyed at Les Artaud. And at each
      satisfactory reply he murmured, as if to himself in a tone of reassurance:
      &lsquo;Come, so much the better; that&rsquo;s just as it should be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He displayed peculiar anxiety about the young priest&rsquo;s state of health.
      And Serge, greatly surprised, assured him that he was in splendid trim,
      and had neither fits of giddiness or of nausea, nor headaches whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capital, capital,&rsquo; reiterated his uncle Pascal. &lsquo;In spring, you see, the
      blood is active. But you are sound enough. By-the-bye, I saw your brother
      Octave at Marseilles last month. He is off to Paris, where he will get a
      fine berth in a high-class business. The young beggar, a nice life he
      leads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What life?&rsquo; innocently inquired the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid replying the doctor chirruped to his horse, and then went on:
      &lsquo;Briefly, everybody is well&mdash;your aunt Felicite, your uncle Rougon,
      and the others. Still, that does not hinder our needing your prayers. You
      are the saint of the family, my lad; I rely upon you to save the whole
      lot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but in such a friendly, good-humoured way that Serge himself
      began to indulge in jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; continued Pascal, &lsquo;there are some among the lot whom it won&rsquo;t
      be easy to lead to Paradise. Some nice confessions you&rsquo;d hear if all came
      in turn. For my part, I can do without their confessions; I watch them
      from a distance; I have got their records at home among my botanical
      specimens and medical notes. Some day I shall be able to draw up a
      wondrously interesting diagram. We shall see; we shall see!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was forgetting himself, carried away by his enthusiasm for science. A
      glance at his nephew&rsquo;s cassock pulled him up short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for you, you&rsquo;re a parson,&rsquo; he muttered; &lsquo;you did well; a parson&rsquo;s a
      very happy man. The calling absorbs you, eh? And so you&rsquo;ve taken to the
      good path. Well! you would never have been satisfied otherwise. Your
      relatives, starting like you, have done a deal of evil, and still they are
      unsatisfied. It&rsquo;s all logically perfect, my lad. A priest completes the
      family. Besides, it was inevitable. Our blood was bound to run to that. So
      much the better for you; you have had the most luck.&rsquo; Correcting himself,
      however, with a strange smile, he added: &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s your sister Desiree who
      has had the best luck of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He whistled, whipped up his horse, and changed the conversation. The gig,
      after climbing a somewhat steep slope, was threading its way through
      desolate ravines; at last it reached a tableland, where the hollow road
      skirted an interminable and lofty wall. Les Artaud had disappeared; they
      found themselves in the heart of a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are getting near, are we not?&rsquo; asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the Paradou,&rsquo; replied the doctor, pointing to the wall. &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t
      you been this way before, then? We are not three miles from Les Artaud. A
      splendid property it must have been, this Paradou. The park wall this side
      alone is quite a mile and a half long. But for over a hundred years it&rsquo;s
      all been running wild.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are some fine trees,&rsquo; observed the Abbe, as he looked up in
      astonishment at the luxuriant mass of foliage which jutted over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that part is very fertile. In fact, the park is a regular forest
      amidst the bare rocks which surround it. The Mascle, too, rises there; I
      have heard four or five springs mentioned, I fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In short sentences, interspersed with irrelevant digressions, he then
      related the story of the Paradou, according to the current legend of the
      countryside. In the time of Louis XV., a great lord had erected a
      magnificent palace there, with vast gardens, fountains, trickling streams,
      and statues&mdash;a miniature Versailles hidden away among the stones,
      under the full blaze of the southern sun. But he had there spent but one
      season with a lady of bewitching beauty, who doubtless died there, as none
      had ever seen her leave. Next year the mansion was destroyed by fire, the
      park doors were nailed up, the very loopholes of the walls were filled
      with mould; and thus, since that remote time, not a glance had penetrated
      that vast enclosure which covered the whole of one of the plateaux of the
      Garrigue hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There can be no lack of nettles there,&rsquo; laughingly said Abbe Mouret.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you find that the whole wall reeks of damp, uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed, and he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whom does the Paradou belong to now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, nobody knows,&rsquo; the doctor answered. &lsquo;The owner did come here once,
      some twenty years ago. But he was so scared by the sight of this adders&rsquo; 
      nest that he has never turned up since. The real master is the caretaker,
      that old oddity, Jeanbernat, who has managed to find quarters in a lodge
      where the stones still hang together. There it is, see&mdash;that grey
      building yonder, with its windows all smothered in ivy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig passed by a lordly iron gate, ruddy with rust, and lined inside
      with a layer of boards. The wide dry throats were black with brambles. A
      hundred yards further on was the lodge inhabited by Jeanbernat. It stood
      within the park, which it overlooked. But the old keeper had apparently
      blocked up that side of his dwelling, and had cleared a little garden by
      the road. And there he lived, facing southwards, with his back turned upon
      the Paradou, as if unaware of the immensity of verdure that stretched away
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest jumped down, looking inquisitively around him and
      questioning the doctor, who was hurriedly fastening the horse to a ring
      fixed in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the old man lives all alone in this out-of-the-way hole?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, quite alone,&rsquo; replied his uncle, adding, however, the next minute:
      &lsquo;Well, he has with him a niece whom he had to take in, a queer girl, a
      regular savage. But we must make haste. The whole place looks death-like.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The house with its shutters closed seemed wrapped in slumber as it stood
      there in the midday sun, amidst the hum of the big flies that swarmed all
      up the ivy to the roof tiles. The sunlit ruin was steeped in happy
      quietude. When the doctor had opened the gate of the narrow garden, which
      was enclosed by a lofty quickset hedge, there, in the shadow cast by a
      wall, they found Jeanbernat, tall and erect, and calmly smoking his pipe,
      as in the deep silence he watched his vegetables grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, are you up then, you humbug?&rsquo; exclaimed the astonished doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you were coming to bury me, were you?&rsquo; growled the old man harshly. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want anybody. I bled myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short as he caught sight of the priest, and assumed so
      threatening an expression that the doctor hastened to intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my nephew,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the new Cure of Les Artaud&mdash;a good
      fellow, too. Devil take it, we haven&rsquo;t been bowling over the roads at this
      hour of the day to eat you, Jeanbernat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man calmed down a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any shavelings here,&rsquo; he grumbled. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re enough to make
      one croak. Mind, doctor, no priests, and no physics when I go off, or we
      shall quarrel. Let him come in, however, as he is your nephew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, struck dumb with amazement, could not speak a word. He stood
      there in the middle of the path scanning that strange solitaire, with
      scorched, brick-tinted face, and limbs all withered and twisted like a
      bundle of ropes, who seemed to bear the burden of his eighty years with a
      scornful contempt for life. When the doctor attempted to feel his pulse,
      his ill-humour broke out afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do leave me in peace! I bled myself with my knife, I tell you. It&rsquo;s all
      over, now. Who was the fool of a peasant who disturbed you? The doctor
      here, and the priest as well, why not the mutes too! Well, it can&rsquo;t be
      helped, people will be fools. It won&rsquo;t prevent us from having a drink,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He fetched a bottle and three glasses, and stood them on an old table
      which he brought out into the shade. Then, having filled the glasses to
      the brim, he insisted on clinking them. His anger had given place to
      jeering cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t poison you, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;A glass of good wine
      isn&rsquo;t a sin. Upon my word, however, this is the first time I ever clinked
      a glass with a cassock, but no offence to you. That poor Abbe Caffin, your
      predecessor, refused to argue with me. He was afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanbernat gave vent to a hearty laugh, and then went on: &lsquo;Just fancy, he
      had pledged himself that he would prove to me that God exists. So,
      whenever I met him, I defied him to do it; and he sloped off crestfallen,
      I can tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, God does not exist!&rsquo; cried Abbe Mouret, roused from his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! just as you please,&rsquo; mockingly replied Jeanbernat. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll begin
      together all over again, if it&rsquo;s any pleasure to you. But I warn you that
      I&rsquo;m a tough hand at it. There are some thousands of books in one of the
      rooms upstairs, which were rescued from the fire at the Paradou: all the
      philosophers of the eighteenth century, a whole heap of old books on
      religion. I&rsquo;ve learned some fine things from them. I&rsquo;ve been reading them
      these twenty years. Marry! you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ve got some one who can talk,
      Monsieur le Cure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen, slowly waving his hand towards the surrounding horizon, to
      the earth and to the sky, and repeating solemnly: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing,
      nothing, nothing. When the sun is snuffed out, all will be at an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Pascal nudged Abbe Mouret with his elbow. With blinking eyes he was
      curiously observing the old man and nodding approvingly in order to induce
      him to talk. &lsquo;So you are a materialist, Jeanbernat?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am only a poor man,&rsquo; replied the old fellow, relighting his pipe.
      &lsquo;When Count de Corbiere, whose foster-brother I was, died from a fall from
      his horse, his children sent me here to look after this park of the
      Sleeping Beauty, in order to get rid of me. I was sixty years old then,
      and I thought I was about done. But death forgot me; and I had to make
      myself a burrow. If one lives all alone, look you, one gets to see things
      in rather a queer fashion. The trees are no longer trees, the earth puts
      on the ways of a living being, the stones seem to tell you tales. A parcel
      of rubbish, eh? But I know some secrets that would fairly stagger you.
      Besides, what do you think there is to do in this devilish desert? I read
      the old books; it was more amusing than shooting. The Count, who used to
      curse like a heathen, was always saying to me: &ldquo;Jeanbernat, my boy, I
      fully expect to meet you again in the hot place, so that you will be able
      to serve me there as you have up here.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he waved his hand to the horizon and added: &lsquo;You hear, nothing;
      there&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s all foolery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Pascal began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pleasant piece of foolery, at any rate,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Jeanbernat, you are
      a deceiver. I suspect you are in love, in spite of your affectation of
      being <i>blase</i>. You were speaking very tenderly of the trees and
      stones just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, I assure you,&rsquo; murmured the old man, &lsquo;I have done with that. At
      one time, it&rsquo;s true, when I first knew you and used to go herborising with
      you, I was stupid enough to love all sorts of things I came across in that
      huge liar, the country. Fortunately, the old volumes have killed all that.
      I only wish my garden was smaller; I don&rsquo;t go out into the road twice a
      year. You see that bench? That&rsquo;s where I spend all my time, just watching
      my lettuces grow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what about your rounds in the park?&rsquo; broke in the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the park!&rsquo; repeated Jeanbernat, with a look of profound surprise.
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s more than twelve years since I set foot in it! What do you
      suppose I could do inside that cemetery? It&rsquo;s too big. It&rsquo;s stupid, what
      with those endless trees and moss everywhere and broken statues, and holes
      in which one might break one&rsquo;s neck at every step. The last time I went in
      there, it was so dark under the trees, there was such a stink of wild
      flowers, and such queer breezes blew along the paths, that I felt almost
      afraid. So I have shut myself up to prevent the park coming in here. A
      patch of sunlight, three feet of lettuce before me, and a big hedge
      shutting out all the view, why, that&rsquo;s more than enough for happiness.
      Nothing, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like, nothing at all, something so tiny that
      nothing from outside could come to disturb me. Seven feet of earth, if you
      like, just to be able to croak on my back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck the table with his fist, and suddenly raised his voice to call
      out to Abbe Mouret: &lsquo;Come, just another glass, your reverence. The old
      gentleman isn&rsquo;t at the bottom of the bottle, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest felt ill at ease. To lead back to God that singular old man,
      whose reason seemed to him to be strangely disordered, appeared a task
      beyond his powers. He now remembered certain bits of gossip he had heard
      from La Teuse about the Philosopher, as the peasants of Les Artaud dubbed
      Jeanbernat. Scraps of scandalous stories vaguely floated in his memory. He
      rose, making a sign to the doctor that he wished to leave this house,
      where he seemed to inhale an odour of damnation. But, in spite of his
      covert fears, a strange feeling of curiosity made him linger. He simply
      walked to the end of the garden, throwing a searching glance into the
      vestibule, as if to see beyond it, behind the walls. All he could
      perceive, however, through the gaping doorway, was the black staircase. So
      he came back again, and sought for some hole, some glimpse of that sea of
      foliage which he knew was near by the mighty murmur that broke upon the
      house, like the sound of waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is the little one well?&rsquo; asked the doctor, taking up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well,&rsquo; answered Jeanbernat. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s never here. She often
      disappears all day long&mdash;still, she may be in the upstair rooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head and called: &lsquo;Albine! Albine!&rsquo; Then with a shrug of his
      shoulders, he added: &lsquo;Yes, my word, she is a nice hussy.... Well, till
      next time, Monsieur le Cure. I&rsquo;m always at your disposal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, however, had no time to accept the Philosopher&rsquo;s challenge. A
      door suddenly opened at the end of the vestibule; a dazzling breach was
      made in the black darkness of the wall, and through the breach came a
      vision of a virgin forest, a great depth of woodland, beneath a flood of
      sunbeams. In that sudden blaze of light the priest distinctly perceived
      certain far-away things: a large yellow flower in the middle of a lawn, a
      sheet of water falling from a lofty rock, a colossal tree filled with a
      swarm of birds; and all this steeped, lost, blazing in such a tangle of
      greenery, such riotous luxuriance of vegetation, that the whole horizon
      seemed one great burst of shooting foliage. The door banged to, and
      everything vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! the jade!&rsquo; cried Jeanbernat, &lsquo;she was in the Paradou again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine was now laughing on the threshold of the vestibule. She wore an
      orange-coloured skirt, with a large red kerchief fastened round her waist,
      thus looking like some gipsy in holiday garb. And she went on laughing,
      her head thrown back, her bosom swelling with mirth, delighted with her
      flowers, wild flowers which she had plaited into her fair hair, fastened
      to her neck, her bodice, and her bare slender golden arms. She seemed like
      a huge nosegay, exhaling a powerful perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, you are a beauty!&rsquo; growled the old man. &lsquo;You smell of weeds enough to
      poison one&mdash;would any one think she was sixteen, that doll?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine remained unabashed, however, and laughed still more heartily.
      Doctor Pascal, who was her great friend, let her kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you are not frightened in the Paradou?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frightened? What of?&rsquo; she said, her eyes wide open with astonishment.
      &lsquo;The walls are too high, no one can get in. There&rsquo;s only myself. It is my
      garden, all my very own. A fine big one, too. I haven&rsquo;t found out where it
      ends yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the animals?&rsquo; interrupted the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The animals? Oh! they don&rsquo;t hurt; they all know me well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is very dark under the trees?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Course! there&rsquo;s shade: if there were none, the sun would burn my face up.
      It is very pleasant in the shade among the leaves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She flitted about, filling the little garden with the rustling sweep of
      her skirts, and scattering round the pungent odour of wild flowers which
      clung to her. She had smiled at Abbe Mouret without trace of shyness,
      without heed of the astonished look with which he observed her. The priest
      had stepped aside. That fair-haired maid, with long oval face, glowing
      with life, seemed to him to be the weird mysterious offspring of the
      forest of which he had caught a glimpse in a sheet of sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, I have got some blackbird nestlings; would you like them?&rsquo; Albine
      asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thanks,&rsquo; he answered, laughing. &lsquo;You should give them to the Cure&rsquo;s
      sister; she is very fond of pets. Good day, Jeanbernat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine, however, had fastened on the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are the vicar of Les Artaud, aren&rsquo;t you? You have a sister? I&rsquo;ll go
      and see her. Only you must not speak to me about God. My uncle will not
      have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You bother us, be off,&rsquo; exclaimed Jeanbernat, shrugging his shoulders.
      Then bounding away like a goat, dropping a shower of flowers behind her,
      she disappeared. The slam of a door was heard, and from behind the house
      came bursts of laughter, which died away in the distance like the
      scampering rush of some mad animal let loose among the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see, she will end by sleeping in the Paradou,&rsquo; muttered the old
      man with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he saw his visitors off, he added: &lsquo;If you should find me dead one
      of these fine days, doctor, just do me the favour of pitching me into the
      muck-pit there, behind my lettuces. Good evening, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He let the wooden gate which closed the hedge fall to again, and the house
      assumed once more its aspect of happy peacefulness in the noonday
      sunlight, amidst the buzzing of the big flies that swarmed all up the ivy
      even to the roof tiles.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The gig once more rolled along the road skirting the Paradou&rsquo;s
      interminable wall. Abbe Mouret, still silent, scanned with upturned eyes
      the huge boughs which stretched over that wall, like the arms of giants
      hidden there. All sorts of sounds came from the park: rustling of wings,
      quivering of leaves, furtive bounds at which branches snapped, mighty
      sighs that bowed the young shoots&mdash;a vast breath of life sweeping
      over the crests of a nation of trees. At times, as he heard a birdlike
      note that seemed like a human laugh, the priest turned his head, as if he
      felt uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A queer girl!&rsquo; said his uncle as he eased the reins a little. &lsquo;She was
      nine years old when she took up her quarters with that old heathen. Some
      brother of his had ruined himself, though in what I can&rsquo;t remember. The
      little one was at school somewhere when her father killed himself. She was
      even quite a little lady, up to reading, embroidery, chattering, and
      strumming on the piano. And such a coquette too! I saw her arrive with
      open-worked stockings, embroidered skirts, frills, cuffs, a heap of
      finery. Ah, well! the finery didn&rsquo;t last long!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. A big stone nearly upset the gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be lucky if I don&rsquo;t leave a wheel in this cursed road!&rsquo; he
      muttered. &lsquo;Hold on, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall still stretched beside them: the priest still listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you may well imagine,&rsquo; continued the doctor, &lsquo;the Paradou, what with
      its sun, its stones, and its thistles, would wreck a whole outfit every
      day. Three or four mouthfuls, that&rsquo;s all it made of all the little one&rsquo;s
      beautiful dresses. She used to come back naked. Now she dresses like a
      savage. To-day she was rather presentable; but sometimes she has scarcely
      anything on beyond her shoes and chemise. Did you hear her? The Paradou is
      hers. The very day after she came she took possession of it. She lives in
      it; jumps out of the window when Jeanbernat locks the door, bolts off in
      spite of all, goes nobody knows whither, buries herself in some invisible
      burrows known only to herself. She must have a fine time in that
      wilderness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark, uncle!&rsquo; interrupted Abbe Mouret. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that some animal running
      behind the wall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Pascal listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said after a minute&rsquo;s silence, &lsquo;it is the rattle of the trap on
      the stones. No, the child doesn&rsquo;t play the piano now. I believe she has
      even forgotten how to read. Just picture to yourself a young lady gone
      back to a state of primevalness, turned out to play on a desert island. My
      word, if ever you get to know of a girl who needs proper bringing up, I
      advise you not to entrust her to Jeanbernat. He has a most primitive way
      of letting nature alone. When I ventured to speak to him about Albine he
      answered me that he must not prevent trees from growing as they pleased.
      He says he is for the normal development of temperaments.... All the same,
      they are very interesting, both of them. I never come this way without
      paying them a visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig was now emerging from the hollowed road. At this point the wall of
      the Paradou turned and wound along the crest of the hills as far as one
      could see. As Abbe Mouret turned to take a last look at that grey-hued
      barrier, whose impenetrable austerity had at last begun to annoy him, a
      rustling of shaken boughs was heard and a clump of young birch trees
      seemed to bow in greeting from above the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew some animal was running behind,&rsquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although nobody could be seen, though nothing was visible in the air
      above save the birches rocking more and more violently, they heard a
      clear, laughing voice call out: &lsquo;Good-bye, doctor! good-bye, Monsieur le
      Cure! I am kissing the tree, and the tree is sending you my kisses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why! it is Albine,&rsquo; exclaimed Doctor Pascal. &lsquo;She must have followed the
      trap at a run. Jumping over bushes is mere play to her, the little elf!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he in his turn shouted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, my pet! How tall you must be to bow like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The laughter grew louder, the birches bowed still lower, scattering their
      leaves around even on the hood of the gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am as tall as the trees; all the leaves that fall are kisses,&rsquo; replied
      the voice now mellowed by distance, so musical, so merged into the
      rippling whispers of the park, that the young priest was thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road grew better. On coming down the slope Les Artaud reappeared in
      the midst of the scorched plain. When the gig reached the turning to the
      village, Abbe Mouret would not let his uncle drive him back to the
      vicarage. He jumped down, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thanks, I prefer to walk: it will do me good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, just as you like,&rsquo; at last answered the doctor. And with a clasp of
      the hand, he added: &lsquo;Well, if you only had such parishioners as that old
      brute Jeanbernat, you wouldn&rsquo;t often be disturbed. However, you yourself
      wanted to come. And mind you keep well. At the slightest ache, night or
      day, send for me. You know I attend all the family gratis.... There,
      good-bye, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret felt more at ease when he found himself again alone, walking
      along the dusty road. The stony fields brought him back to his dream of
      austerity, of an inner life spent in a desert. From the trees all along
      the sunken road disturbing moisture had fallen on his neck, which now the
      burning sun was drying. The sight of the lean almond trees, the scanty
      corn crops, the weak vines, on either side of the way, soothed him,
      delivered him from the perturbation into which the lusty atmosphere of the
      Paradou had thrown him. Amid the blinding glare that flowed from heaven
      over the bare land, Jeanbernat&rsquo;s blasphemies no longer cast even a shadow.
      A thrill of pleasure ran through the priest as he raised his head and
      caught sight of the solitaire&rsquo;s motionless bar-like silhouette and the
      pink patch of tiles on the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he walked on, fresh anxiety beset the Abbe. La Teuse would give
      him a fine reception; for his luncheon must have been waiting nearly two
      hours for him. He pictured her terrible face, the flood of words with
      which she would greet him, the angry clatter of kitchen ware which he
      would hear the whole afternoon. When he had got through Les Artaud, his
      fear became so lively that he hesitated, full of trepidation, and wondered
      if it would not be better to go round and reach the parsonage by way of
      the church. But, while he deliberated, La Teuse herself appeared on the
      doorstep of the parsonage, her cap all awry, and her hands on her hips.
      With drooping head he had perforce to climb the slope under her
      storm-laden gaze, which he could feel weighing upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe I am rather late, my good Teuse,&rsquo; he stammered, as he turned
      the path&rsquo;s last bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse waited till he stood quite close before her. She then gave him a
      furious glance, and, without a word, turned and stalked before him into
      the dining-room, banging her big heels upon the floor-tiles and so rigid
      with ire that she hardly limped at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had so many things to do,&rsquo; began the priest, scared by this dumb
      reception. &lsquo;I have been running about all the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she cut him short with another look, so fixed, so full of anger, that
      he felt his legs give way under him. He sat down, and began to eat. She
      waited on him in the sharp, mechanical manner of an automaton, all but
      breaking the plates with the violence with which she set them down. The
      silence became so awful that, choking with emotion, he was unable to
      swallow his third mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister has had her luncheon?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Quite right of her. Luncheon
      should always be served whenever I am kept out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came. La Teuse stood there waiting to remove his plate as soon
      as he should have emptied it. Thereupon, feeling that he could not
      possibly eat with those implacable eyes crushing him, he pushed his plate
      away. This angry gesture acted on La Teuse like a whip stroke, rousing her
      from her obstinate stiffness. She fairly jumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s how it is!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;There you are again, losing your
      temper! Very well, I am off; you can pay my fare, so that I may go back
      home. I have had enough of Les Artaud, and your church, and everything
      else!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her apron with trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have seen that I didn&rsquo;t wish to say anything to you. A nice
      life, indeed! Only mountebanks do such things, Monsieur le Cure! This is
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, ain&rsquo;t it! Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of sitting at table when it&rsquo;s
      almost two o&rsquo;clock? It&rsquo;s not like a Christian, no, it is not like a
      Christian!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, taking her stand before him, she went on: &lsquo;Well, where do you come
      from? whom have you seen? what business can have kept you? If only you
      were a child you would have the whip. It isn&rsquo;t the place for a priest to
      be, on the roads in the blazing sun like a tramp without a roof to put
      over his head. A fine state you are in, with your shoes all white and your
      cassock smothered in dust! Who will brush your cassock for you? Who will
      buy you another one? Speak out, will you; tell me what you have been
      doing! My word! if everybody didn&rsquo;t know you, they would end by thinking
      queer things about you. And shall I tell you? Why, I won&rsquo;t say but what
      you may have been up to something wrong. When folks lunch at such hours
      they are capable of anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret let the storm blow over him. At the old servant&rsquo;s wrathful
      words he experienced a kind of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, my good Teuse,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you will first put your apron on again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all over, I am going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he got up and, laughing, tied her apron round her waist. She struggled
      against him and stuttered: &lsquo;I tell you no! You are a wheedler. I can see
      through your game, I see you want to come it over me with your honeyed
      words. Where did you go? We&rsquo;ll see afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gaily sat down to table again like a man who has gained a victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First, I must be allowed to eat. I am dying with hunger,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; she murmured, her pity moved. &lsquo;Is there any common sense in
      it? Would you like me to fry you a couple of eggs? It would not take long.
      Well, if you have enough. But everything is cold! And I had taken such
      pains with your aubergines! Nice they are now! They look like old
      shoe-leather. Luckily you haven&rsquo;t got a tender tooth like poor Monsieur
      Caffin. Yes, you have some good points, I don&rsquo;t deny it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus chattering, she waited on him with all a mother&rsquo;s care. After he had
      finished she ran to the kitchen to see if the coffee was still warm. She
      frisked about and limped most outrageously in her delight at having made
      things up with him. As a rule Abbe Mouret fought shy of coffee, which
      always upset his nervous system; but on this occasion, to ratify the
      conclusion of peace, he took the cup she brought him. And as he lingered
      at table she sat down opposite him and repeated gently, like a woman
      tortured by curiosity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been, Monsieur le Cure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he answered with a smile, &lsquo;I have seen the Brichets, I have spoken
      to Bambousse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he had to relate to her what the Brichets had said, what
      Bambousse had decided, and how they looked, and where they were at work.
      When he repeated to her the answer of Rosalie&rsquo;s father, &lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; she
      exclaimed, &lsquo;if the child should die her mishap would go for nothing.&rsquo; And
      clasping her hands with a look of envious admiration she added, &lsquo;How you
      must have chattered, your reverence! More than half the day spent to
      obtain such a fine result! You took it easy coming home? It must have been
      very hot on the road?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe, who by this time had risen, made no answer. He had been on the
      point of speaking about the Paradou, and asking for some information
      concerning it. But a fear of being flooded with eager questions, and a
      kind of vague unavowed shame, made him keep silence respecting his visit
      to Jeanbernat. He cut all further questions short by asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is my sister? I don&rsquo;t hear her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, sir,&rsquo; said La Teuse, beginning to laugh, and raising her
      finger to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the next room, a country drawing-room, hung with faded
      wall-paper showing large grey flowers, and furnished with four armchairs
      and a sofa, covered with horse-hair. On the sofa now slept Desiree,
      stretched out at full length, with her head resting on her clenched hands.
      The pronounced curve of her bosom was raised somewhat by her upstretched
      arms, bare to the elbows. She was breathing somewhat heavily, her red lips
      parted, and thus showing her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord! isn&rsquo;t she sleeping sound!&rsquo; whispered La Teuse. &lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t even
      hear you pitching into me just now. Well, she must be precious tired. Just
      fancy, she was cleaning up her yard till nearly noon. And when she had
      eaten something, she came and dropped down there like a shot. She has not
      stirred since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the priest gazed lovingly at her. &lsquo;We must let her have as
      much rest as she wants,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. Isn&rsquo;t it a pity she&rsquo;s such an innocent? Just look at those big
      arms! Whenever I dress her I always think what a fine woman she would have
      made. Ay, she would have brought you some splendid nephews, sir. Don&rsquo;t you
      think she is like that stone lady in Plassans corn-market?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke thus of a Cybele stretched upon sheaves of wheat, the work of
      one of Puget&rsquo;s pupils, which was carved on the frontal of the market
      building. Without replying, however, Abbe Mouret gently pushed her out of
      the room, and begged her to make as little noise as possible. Till
      evening, therefore, perfect silence settled on the parsonage. La Teuse
      finished her washing in the shed. The priest, seated at the bottom of the
      little garden, his breviary fallen on his lap, remained absorbed in pious
      thoughts, while all around him rosy petals rained from the blossoming
      peach-trees.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      About six o&rsquo;clock there came a sudden wakening. A noise of doors opening
      and closing, accompanied by bursts of laughter, shook the whole house.
      Desiree appeared, her hair all down and her arms still half bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge!&rsquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      And catching sight of her brother in the garden, she ran up to him and sat
      down for a minute on the ground at his feet, begging him to follow her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do come and see the animals! You haven&rsquo;t seen the animals yet, have you?
      If you only knew how beautiful they are now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to beg very hard, for the yard rather scared him. But when he saw
      tears in Desiree&rsquo;s eyes, he yielded. She threw herself on his neck in a
      sudden puppy-like burst of glee, laughing more than ever, without
      attempting to dry her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! how nice you are!&rsquo; she stammered, as she dragged him off. &lsquo;You shall
      see the hens, the rabbits, the pigeons, and my ducks which have got fresh
      water, and my goat, whose room is as clean as mine now. I have three geese
      and two turkeys, you know. Come quick. You shall see all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree was then twenty-two years old. Reared in the country by her nurse,
      a peasant woman of Saint-Eutrope, she had grown up anyhow. Her brain void
      of all serious thoughts, she had thriven on the fat soil and open air of
      the country, developing physically but never mentally, growing into a
      lovely animal&mdash;white, with rosy blood and firm skin. She was not
      unlike a high-bred donkey endowed with the power of laughter. Although she
      dabbled about from morning till night, her delicate hands and feet, the
      supple outlines of her hips, the bourgeois refinement of her maiden form
      remained unimpaired; so that she was in truth a creature apart&mdash;neither
      lady nor peasant&mdash;but a girl nourished by the soil, with the broad
      shoulders and narrow brow of a youthful goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless it was by reason of her weak intellect that she was drawn
      towards animals. She was never happy save with them; she understood their
      language far better than that of mankind, and looked after them with
      motherly affection. Her reasoning powers were deficient, but in lieu
      thereof she had an instinct which put her on a footing of intelligence
      with them. At their very first cry of pain she knew what ailed them; she
      would choose dainties upon which they would pounce greedily. A single
      gesture from her quelled their squabbles. She seemed to know their good or
      their evil character at a glance; and related such long tales about the
      tiniest chick, with such an abundance and minuteness of detail, as to
      astound those to whom one chicken was exactly like any other. Her farmyard
      had thus become a country, as it were, over which she reigned; a country
      complex in its organisation, disturbed by rebellions, peopled by the most
      diverse creatures whose records were known to her alone. So accurate was
      her instinct that she detected the unfertile eggs in a sitting, and
      foretold the number of a litter of rabbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at sixteen, Desiree became a young woman, she retained all her
      wonted health; and rapidly developed, with round, free-swaying bust, broad
      hips like those of an antique statue, the full growth indeed of a vigorous
      animal. One might have thought that she had sprung from the rich soil of
      her poultry-yard, that she absorbed the sap with her sturdy legs, which
      were as firm as young trees. And nought disturbed her amidst all this
      plenitude. She found continuous satisfaction in being surrounded by birds
      and animals which ever increased and multiplied, their fruitfulness
      filling her with delight. Nothing could have been healthier. She
      innocently feasted on the odour and warmth of life, knowing no depraved
      curiosity, but retaining all the tranquillity of a beautiful animal,
      simply happy at seeing her little world thus multiply, feeling as if she
      thereby became a mother, the common natural mother of one and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since she had been living at Les Artaud, she had spent her days in
      complete beatitude. At last she was satisfying the dream of her life, the
      only desire which had worried her amidst her weak-minded puerility. She
      had a poultry-yard, a nook all to herself, where she could breed animals
      to her heart&rsquo;s content. And she almost lived there, building
      rabbit-hutches with her own hands, digging out a pond for the ducks,
      knocking in nails, fetching straw, allowing no one to assist her. All that
      La Teuse had to do was to wash her afterwards. The poultry-yard was
      situated behind the cemetery; and Desiree often had to jump the wall, and
      run hither and thither among the graves after some fowl whom curiosity had
      led astray. Right at the end was a shed giving accommodation to the fowls
      and the rabbits; to the right was a little stable for the goat. Moreover,
      all the animals lived together; the rabbits ran about with the fowls, the
      nanny-goat would take a footbath in the midst of the ducks; the geese, the
      turkeys, the guinea-fowls, and the pigeons all fraternised in the company
      of three cats. Whenever Desiree appeared at the wooden fence which
      prevented her charges from making their way into the church, a deafening
      uproar greeted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! can&rsquo;t you hear them?&rsquo; she said to her brother, as they reached the
      dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when she had admitted him and closed the gate behind them, she was
      assailed so violently that she almost disappeared. The ducks and the
      geese, opening and shutting their beaks, tugged at her skirts; the greedy
      hens sprang up and pecked her hands; the rabbits squatted on her feet and
      then bounded up to her knees; whilst the three cats leapt upon her
      shoulders, and the goat bleated in its stable at being unable to reach
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave me alone, do! all you creatures!&rsquo; she cried with a hearty sonorous
      laugh, feeling tickled by all the feathers, claws, and beaks and paws
      rubbing against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she did not attempt to free herself. As she often said, she would
      have let herself be devoured; it seemed so sweet to feel all this life
      cling to her and encompass her with the warmth of eider-down. At last only
      one cat persisted in remaining on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Moumou,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;His paws are like velvet.&rsquo; Then, calling her
      brother&rsquo;s attention to the yard, she proudly added: &lsquo;See, how clean it
      is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard had indeed been swept out, washed, and raked over. But the
      disturbed water and the forked-up litter exhaled so fetid and powerful an
      odour that Abbe Mouret half choked. The dung was heaped against the
      graveyard wall in a huge smoking mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a pile, eh?&rsquo; continued Desiree, leading her brother into the pungent
      vapour, &lsquo;I put it all there myself, nobody helped me. Go on, it isn&rsquo;t
      dirty. It cleans. Look at my arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she held out her arms, which she had merely dipped into a
      pail of water&mdash;regal arms they were, superbly rounded, blooming like
      full white roses amidst the manure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; gently said the priest, &lsquo;you have worked hard. It&rsquo;s very nice
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned towards the wicket, but she stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do wait a bit. You shall see them all. You have no idea&mdash;&rsquo; And so
      saying, she dragged him to the rabbit house under the shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are young ones in all the hutches,&rsquo; she said, clapping her hands in
      glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at great length she proceeded to explain to him all about the
      litters. He had to crouch down and come close to the wire netting, whilst
      she gave him minute details. The mother does, with big restless ears, eyed
      him askance, panting and motionless with fear. Then, in one hutch, he saw
      a hairy cavity wherein crawled a living heap, an indistinct dusky mass
      heaving like a single body. Close by some young ones, with enormous heads,
      ventured to the edge of the hole. A little farther were yet stronger ones,
      who looked like young rats, ferreting and leaping about with their raised
      rumps showing their white scuts. Others, white ones with pale ruby eyes,
      and black ones with jet eyes, galloped round their hutches with playful
      grace. Now a scare would make them bolt off swiftly, revealing at every
      leap their slender reddened paws. Next they would squat down all in a
      heap, so closely packed that their heads could no longer be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is you they are frightened at,&rsquo; Desiree kept on saying. &lsquo;They know me
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She called them and drew some bread-crust from her pocket. The little
      rabbits then became more confident, and, with puckered noses, kept sidling
      up, and rearing against the netting one by one. She kept them like that
      for a minute to show her brother the rosy down upon their bellies, and
      then gave her crust to the boldest one. Upon this the whole of them
      flocked up, sliding forward and squeezing one another, but never
      quarreling. At one moment three little ones were all nibbling the same
      piece of crust, but others darted away, turning to the wall so as to eat
      in peace, while their mothers in the rear remained snuffing distrustfully
      and refused the crusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the greedy little things!&rsquo; exclaimed Desiree. &lsquo;They would eat like
      that till to-morrow morning! At night, even, you can bear them crunching
      the leaves they have overlooked in the day-time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had risen as if to depart, but she never wearied of smiling on
      her dear little ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see the big one there, that&rsquo;s all white, with black ears&mdash;Well!
      he dotes on poppies. He is very clever at picking them out from the other
      weeds. The other day he got the colic. So I took him and kept him warm in
      my pocket. Since then he has been quite frisky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She poked her fingers through the wire netting and stroked the rabbits&rsquo; 
      backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you say it was satin?&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;They are dressed like
      princes. And ain&rsquo;t they coquettish! Look, there&rsquo;s one who is always
      cleaning himself. He wears the fur off his paws.... If only you knew how
      funny they are! I say nothing, but I see all their little games. That grey
      one looking at us, for instance, used to hate a little doe, which I had to
      put somewhere else. There were terrible scenes between them. It would take
      too long to tell you all, but the last time he gave her a drubbing, when I
      came up in a rage, what do you think I saw? Why that rascal huddled up at
      the back there as if he was just at his last gasp. He wanted to make me
      believe that it was he who had to complain of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Desiree paused to apostrophise the rabbit. &lsquo;Yes, you may listen to
      me; you&rsquo;re a rogue!&rsquo; And turning towards her brother, &lsquo;He understands all
      I say,&rsquo; she added softly, with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abbe Mouret could stand it no longer. He was perturbed by the heat
      that emanated from the litters, the life that crawled under the hair
      plucked from the does&rsquo; bellies, exhaling powerful emanations. On the other
      hand, Desiree, as if slowly intoxicated, was growing brighter and pinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing to take you away!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;you always seem
      anxious to go off. You must see my little chicks! They were born last
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took some rice and threw a handful before her. The hen gravely drew
      near, clucking to the little band of chickens that followed her chirping
      and scampering as if in bewilderment. When they were fairly in the middle
      of the scattered rice the hen eagerly pecked at it, and threw down the
      grains she cracked, while her little ones hastily began to feed. All the
      charm of infancy was theirs. Half-naked as it were, with round heads, eyes
      sparkling like steel needles, beaks so queerly set, and down so quaintly
      ruffled up, they looked like penny toys. Desiree laughed with enjoyment at
      sight of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What little loves they are!&rsquo; she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up two of them, one in each hand, and smothered them with eager
      kisses. And then the priest had to inspect them all over, while she coolly
      said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy to tell the cocks. But I never make a mistake. This one is
      a hen, and this one is a hen too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she set them on the ground again. Other hens were now coming up to
      eat the rice. A large ruddy cock with flaming plumage followed them,
      lifting his large feet with majestic caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alexander is getting splendid,&rsquo; said the Abbe, to please his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander was the cock&rsquo;s name. He looked up at the young girl with his
      fiery eye, his head turned round, his tail outspread, and then installed
      himself close by her skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very fond of me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Only I can touch him. He is a good
      bird. There are fourteen hens, and never do I find a bad egg in the nests.
      Do I, Alexander?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stooped; the bird did not fly from her caress. A rush of blood seemed
      to set his comb aflame; flapping his wings, and stretching out his neck,
      he burst into a long crow which rang out like a blast from a brazen
      throat. Four times did he repeat his crow while all the cocks of Les
      Artaud answered in the distance. Desiree was greatly amused by her
      brother&rsquo;s startled looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He deafens one, eh?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;He has a splendid voice. But he&rsquo;s not
      vicious, I assure you, though the hens are&mdash;You remember the big
      speckled one, that used to lay yellow eggs? Well, the day before yesterday
      she hurt her foot. When the others saw the blood they went quite mad. They
      all followed her, pecking at her and drinking her blood, so that by the
      evening they had eaten up her foot. I found her with her head behind a
      stone, like an idiot, saying nothing, and letting herself be devoured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of the fowls&rsquo; voracity made her laugh. She calmly related
      other cruelties of theirs: young chickens devoured, of which she had only
      found the necks and wings, and a litter of kittens eaten up in the stable
      in a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might give them a human being,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;they&rsquo;d finish him.
      And aren&rsquo;t they tough livers! They get on with a broken limb even. They
      may have wounds, big holes in their bodies, and still they&rsquo;ll gobble their
      victuals. That&rsquo;s what I like them for; their flesh grows again in two
      days; they are always as warm as if they had a store of sunshine under
      their feathers. When I want to give them a treat, I cut them up some raw
      meat. And worms too! Wait, you&rsquo;ll see how they love them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the dungheap, and unhesitatingly picked up a worm she found
      there. The fowls darted at her hands; but to amuse herself with the sight
      of their greediness she held the worm high above them. At last she opened
      her fingers, and forthwith the fowls hustled one another and pounced upon
      the worm. One of them fled with it in her beak, pursued by the others; it
      was thus taken, snatched away, and retaken many times until one hen, with
      a mighty gulp, swallowed it altogether. At that they all stopped short
      with heads thrown back, and eyes on the alert for another worm. Desiree
      called them by their names, and talked pettingly to them; while Abbe
      Mouret retreated a few steps from this display of voracious life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am not at all comfortable,&rsquo; he said to his sister, when she tried
      to make him feel the weight of a fowl she was fattening. &lsquo;It always makes
      me uneasy to touch live animals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to smile, but Desiree taxed him with cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah well, what about my ducks, and geese, and turkeys?&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;What
      would you do if you had all those to look after? Ducks are dirty, if you
      like. Do you hear them shaking their bills in the water? And when they
      dive, you can only see their tails sticking straight up like ninepins.
      Geese and turkeys, too, are not easy to manage. Isn&rsquo;t it fun to see them
      walking along with their long necks, some quite white and others quite
      black? They look like ladies and gentlemen. And I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to
      trust your finger to them. They would swallow it at a gulp. But my
      fingers, they only kiss&mdash;see!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words were cut short by a joyous bleat from the goat, which had at
      last forced the door of the stable open. Two bounds and the animal was
      close to her, bending its forelegs, and affectionately rubbing its horns
      against her. To the priest, with its pointed beard and obliquely set eyes,
      it seemed to wear a diabolical grin. But Desiree caught it round the neck,
      kissed its head, played and ran with it, and talked about how she liked to
      drink its milk. She often did so, she said, when she was thirsty in the
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See, it has plenty of milk,&rsquo; she added, pointing to the animal&rsquo;s udder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest lowered his eyes. He could remember having once seen in the
      cloister of Saint-Saturnin at Plassans a horrible stone gargoyle,
      representing a goat and a monk; and ever since he had always looked on
      goats as dissolute creatures of hell. His sister had only been allowed to
      get one after weeks of begging. For his part, whenever he came to the
      yard, he shunned all contact with the animal&rsquo;s long silky coat, and
      carefully guarded his cassock from the touch of its horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll let you go now,&rsquo; said Desiree, becoming aware of his
      growing discomfort. &lsquo;But you must just let me show you something else
      first. Promise not to scold me, won&rsquo;t you? I have not said anything to you
      about it, because you wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed it.... But if you only knew
      how pleased I am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she put on an entreating expression, clasped her hands, and
      laid her head upon her brother&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another piece of folly, no doubt,&rsquo; he murmured, unable to refrain from
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t mind, will you?&rsquo; she continued, her eyes glistening with
      delight. &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be angry?&mdash;He is so pretty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she ran to open the low door under the shed, and forthwith a
      little pig bounded into the middle of the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! isn&rsquo;t he a cherub?&rsquo; she exclaimed with a look of profound rapture as
      she saw him leap out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little pig was indeed charming, quite pink, his snout washed clean by
      the greasy slops placed before him, though incessant routing in his trough
      had left a ring of dirt about his eyes. He trotted about, hustled the
      fowls, rushing to gobble up whatever was thrown them, and upsetting the
      little yard with his sudden turns and twists. His ears flapped over his
      eyes, his snout went snorting over the ground, and with his slender feet
      he resembled a toy animal on wheels. From behind, his tail looked like a
      bit of string that served to hang him up by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have this beast here!&rsquo; exclaimed the priest, terribly put out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Serge, dear old Serge,&rsquo; begged Desiree again, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be so unkind.
      See, what a harmless little thing he is! I&rsquo;ll wash him, I&rsquo;ll keep him very
      clean. La Teuse went and had him given her for me. We can&rsquo;t send him back
      now. See, he is looking at you; he wants to smell you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, he
      won&rsquo;t eat you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she broke off, seized with irresistible laughter. The little pig had
      blundered in a dazed fashion between the goat&rsquo;s legs, and tripped her up.
      And he was now madly careering round, squeaking, rolling, scaring all the
      denizens of the poultry-yard. To quiet him Desiree had to get him an
      earthen pan full of dish-water. In this he wallowed up to his ears,
      splashing and grunting, while quick quivers of delight coursed over his
      rosy skin. And now his uncurled tail hung limply down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stirring of this foul water put a crowning touch to Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s
      disgust. Ever since he had been there, he had choked more and more; his
      hands and chest and face were afire, and he felt quite giddy. The odour of
      the fowls and rabbits, the goat, and the pig, all mingled in one
      pestilential stench. The atmosphere, laden with the ferments of life, was
      too heavy for his maiden shoulders. And it seemed to him that Desiree had
      grown taller, expanding at the hips, waving huge arms, sweeping the ground
      with her skirts, and stirring up all that powerful odour which overpowered
      him. He had only just time to open the wicket. His feet clung to the stone
      flags still dank with manure, in such wise that it seemed as if he were
      held there by some clasp of the soil. And suddenly, despite himself, there
      came back to him a memory of the Paradou, with its huge trees, its black
      shadows, its penetrating perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, you are quite red now,&rsquo; Desiree said to him as she joined him
      outside the wicket. &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased to have seen everything? Do you
      hear the noise they are making?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing her depart, the birds and animals had thrown themselves against
      the trellis work emitting piteous cries. The little pig, especially, gave
      vent to prolonged whines that suggested the sharpening of a saw. Desiree,
      however, curtsied to them and kissed her finger-tips to them, laughing at
      seeing them all huddled together there, like so many lovers of hers. Then,
      hugging her brother, as she accompanied him to the garden, she whispered
      into his ear with a blush: &lsquo;I should so like a cow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, with a ready gesture of disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, not now,&rsquo; she hurriedly went on. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it again later
      on&mdash;&mdash; But there would be room in the stable. A lovely white cow
      with red spots. You&rsquo;d soon see what nice milk we should have. A goat
      becomes too little in the end. And when the cow has a calf!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mere thought of this she skipped and clapped her hands with glee;
      and to the priest she seemed to have brought the poultry-yard away with
      her in her skirts. So he left her at the end of the garden, sitting in the
      sunlight on the ground before a hive, whence the bees buzzed like golden
      berries round her neck, along her bare arms and in her hair, without
      thought of stinging her.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias dined at the parsonage every Thursday. As a rule he
      came early so as to talk over parish matters. It was he who, for the last
      three months, had kept the Abbe informed of all the affairs of the valley.
      That Thursday, while waiting till La Teuse should call them, they strolled
      about in front of the church. The priest, on relating his interview with
      Bambousse, was surprised to find that the Brother thought the peasant&rsquo;s
      reply quite natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said the Ignorantin.* &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t give away chattels
      like that. Rosalie is no great bargain, but it&rsquo;s always hard to see your
      own daughter throw herself away on a pauper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * A popular name in France for a Christian Brother.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still,&rsquo; rejoined Abbe Mouret, &lsquo;a marriage is the only way of stopping the
      scandal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother shrugged his big shoulders and laughed aggravatingly. &lsquo;Do you
      think you&rsquo;ll cure the neighbourhood with that marriage?&rsquo; he exclaimed.
      &lsquo;Before another two years Catherine will be following her sister&rsquo;s
      example. They all go the same way, and as they end by marrying, they snap
      their fingers at every one. These Artauds flourish in it all, as on a
      congenial dungheap. There is only one possible remedy, as I have told you
      before: wring all the girls&rsquo; necks if you don&rsquo;t want the country to be
      poisoned. No husbands, Monsieur le Cure, but a good thick stick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then calming down a bit, he added: &lsquo;Let every one do with their own as
      they think best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to speak about fixing the hours for the catechism classes; but
      Abbe Mouret replied in an absent-minded way, his eyes dwelling on the
      village at his feet in the setting sun. The peasants were wending their
      way homewards, silently and slowly, with the dragging steps of wearied
      oxen returning to their sheds. Before the tumble-down houses stood women
      calling to one another, carrying on bawling conversations from door to
      door, while bands of children filled the roadway with the riot of their
      big clumsy shoes, grovelling and rolling and pushing each other about. A
      bestial odour ascended from that heap of tottering houses, and the priest
      once more fancied himself in Desiree&rsquo;s poultry-yard, where life ever
      increased and multiplied. Here, too, was the same incessant travail, which
      so disturbed him. Since morning his mind had been running on that episode
      of Rosalie and Fortune, and now his thoughts returned to it, to the foul
      features of existence, the incessant, fated task of Nature, which sowed
      men broadcast like grains of wheat. The Artauds were a herd penned in
      between four ranges of hills, increasing, multiplying, spreading more and
      more thickly over the land with each successive generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See,&rsquo; cried Brother Archangias, interrupting his discourse to point to a
      tall girl who was letting her sweetheart snatch a kiss, &lsquo;there is another
      hussy over there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his long black arms at the couple and made them flee. In the
      distance, over the crimson fields and the peeling rocks, the sun was dying
      in one last flare. Night gradually came on. The warm fragrance of the
      lavender became cooler on the wings of the light evening breeze which now
      arose. From time to time a deep sigh fell on the ear as if that fearful
      land, consumed by ardent passions, had at length grown calm under the soft
      grey rain of twilight. Abbe Mouret, hat in hand, delighted with the
      coolness, once more felt quietude descend upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur le Cure! Brother Archangias!&rsquo; cried La Teuse. &lsquo;Come quick! The
      soup is on the table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cabbage soup, and its odoriferous steam filled the parsonage
      dining-room. The Brother seated himself and fell to, slowly emptying the
      huge plate that La Teuse had put down before him. He was a big eater, and
      clucked his tongue as each mouthful descended audibly into his stomach.
      Keeping his eyes on his spoon, he did not speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t my soup good, then, Monsieur le Cure?&rsquo; the old servant asked the
      priest. &lsquo;You are only fiddling with your plate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not a bit hungry, my good Teuse,&rsquo; Serge replied, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! how can one wonder at it when you go on as you do! But you would
      have been hungry, if you hadn&rsquo;t lunched at past two o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias, tilting into his spoon the last few drops of soup
      remaining in his plate, said gravely: &lsquo;You should be regular in your
      meals, Monsieur le Cure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Desiree, who also had finished her soup, sedately and in
      silence, rose and followed La Teuse to the kitchen. The Brother, then left
      alone with Abbe Mouret, cut himself some long strips of bread, which he
      ate while waiting for the next dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you made a long round to-day?&rsquo; he asked the priest. But before the
      other could reply a noise of footsteps, exclamations, and ringing
      laughter, arose at the end of the passage, in the direction of the yard. A
      short altercation apparently took place. A flute-like voice which
      disturbed the Abbe rose in vexed and hurried accents, which finally died
      away in a burst of glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can it be?&rsquo; said Serge, rising from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Desiree bounded in again, carrying something hidden in her gathered-up
      skirt. And she burst out excitedly: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t she queer? She wouldn&rsquo;t come in
      at all. I caught hold of her dress; but she is awfully strong; she soon
      got away from me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom on earth is she talking about?&rsquo; asked La Teuse, running in from the
      kitchen with a dish of potatoes, across which lay a piece of bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sat down, and with the greatest caution drew from her skirt a
      blackbird&rsquo;s nest in which three wee fledglings were slumbering. She laid
      it on her plate. The moment the little birds felt the light, they
      stretched out their feeble necks and opened their crimson beaks to ask for
      food. Desiree clapped her hands, enchanted, seized with strange emotion at
      the sight of these hitherto unknown creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s that Paradou girl!&rsquo; exclaimed the Abbe suddenly, remembering
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse had gone to the window. &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I might have known
      that grasshopper&rsquo;s voice&mdash;&mdash; Oh! the gipsy! Look, she&rsquo;s stopped
      there to spy on us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret drew near. He, too, thought that he could see Albine&rsquo;s
      orange-coloured skirt behind a juniper bush. But Brother Archangias, in a
      towering passion, raised himself on tiptoe behind him, and, stretching out
      his fist and wagging his churlish head, thundered forth: &lsquo;May the devil
      take you, you brigand&rsquo;s daughter! I will drag you right round the church
      by your hair if ever I catch you coming and casting your evil spells
      here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A peal of laughter, fresh as the breath of night, rang out from the path,
      followed by light hasty footsteps and the swish of a dress rustling
      through the grass like an adder. Abbe Mouret, standing at the window, saw
      something golden glide through the pine trees like a moonbeam. The breeze,
      wafted in from the open country, was now laden with that penetrating
      perfume of verdure, that scent of wildflowers, which Albine had scattered
      from her bare arms, unfettered bosom, and streaming tresses at the
      Paradou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An accursed soul! a child of perdition!&rsquo; growled Brother Archangias, as
      he reseated himself at the dinner table. He fell greedily upon his bacon,
      and swallowed his potatoes whole instead of bread. La Teuse, however,
      could not persuade Desiree to finish her dinner. That big baby was lost in
      ecstasy over the nestlings, asking questions, wanting to know what food
      they ate, if they laid eggs, and how the cockbirds could be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant, however, was troubled by a suspicion, and taking her
      stand on her sound leg, she looked the young cure in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you know the Paradou people?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he simply told the truth, relating the visit he had paid to old
      Jeanbernat. La Teuse exchanged scandalised glances with Brother
      Archangias. At first she answered nothing, but went round and round the
      table, limping frantically and stamping hard enough with her heels to
      split the flooring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might have spoken to me of those people these three months past,&rsquo; 
      said the priest at last. &lsquo;I should have known at any rate what sort of
      people I was going to call upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse stopped short as if her legs had just broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell falsehoods, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; she stuttered, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t tell
      them; you will only make your sin still worse. How dare you say I haven&rsquo;t
      spoken to you of the Philosopher, that heathen who is the scandal of the
      whole neighbourhood? The truth is, you never listen to me when I talk. It
      all goes in at one ear and out at the other. Ah, if you did listen to me,
      you&rsquo;d spare yourself a good deal of trouble!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, too, have spoken to you about those abominations,&rsquo; affirmed the
      Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret lightly shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t remember it,&rsquo; 
      he said. It was only when I found myself at the Paradou that I fancied I
      recollected certain tales. Besides, I should have gone to that unhappy man
      all the same as I thought him in danger of death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias, his mouth full, struck the table violently with his
      knife, and roared: &lsquo;Jeanbernat is a dog; he ought to die like a dog.&rsquo; Then
      seeing the priest about to protest he cut him short: &lsquo;No, no, for him
      there is no God, no penitence, no mercy. It would be better to throw the
      host to the pigs than carry it to that scoundrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he helped himself to more potatoes, and with his elbows on the table,
      his chin in his plate, began chewing furiously. La Teuse, her lips
      pinched, quite white with anger, contented herself with saying dryly: &lsquo;Let
      it be, his reverence will have his own way. He has secrets from us now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence reigned. For a moment one only heard the working of Brother
      Archangias&rsquo;s jaws, and the extraordinary rumbling of his gullet. Desiree,
      with her bare arms round the nest in her plate, smiled to the little ones,
      talking to them slowly and softly in a chirruping of her own which they
      seemed to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People say what they have done when they have nothing to hide,&rsquo; suddenly
      cried La Teuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then silence reigned again. What exasperated the old servant was the
      mystery the priest seemed to make about his visit to the Paradou. She
      deemed herself a woman who had been shamefully deceived. Her curiosity
      smarted. She again walked round the table, not looking at the Abbe, not
      addressing anybody, but comforting herself with soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it; that&rsquo;s why we have lunch so late! We go gadding about till two
      o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. We go into such disreputable houses that we
      don&rsquo;t even dare to tell what we&rsquo;ve done. And then we tell lies, we deceive
      everybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But nobody,&rsquo; gently interrupted Abbe Mouret, who was forcing himself to
      eat a little more, so as to prevent La Teuse from getting crosser than
      ever, &lsquo;nobody asked me if I had been to the Paradou. I have not had to
      tell any lies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse, however, went on as if she had never heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we go ruining our cassock in the dust, we come home rigged up like a
      thief. And if some kind person takes an interest in us, and questions us
      for our own good, we push her about and treat her like a good-for-nothing
      woman, whom we can&rsquo;t trust. We hide things like a slyboots, we&rsquo;d rather
      die than breathe a word; we&rsquo;re not even considerate enough to enliven our
      home by relating what we&rsquo;ve seen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the priest, and looked him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you take that to yourself. You are a close one, you&rsquo;re a bad man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she fell to crying and the Abbe had to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Caffin used to tell me everything,&rsquo; she moaned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she soon grew calmer. Brother Archangias was finishing a big
      piece of cheese, apparently quite unruffled by the scene. In his opinion
      Abbe Mouret really needed being kept straight, and La Teuse was right in
      making him feel the reins. Having drunk a last glassful of the weak wine,
      the Brother threw himself back in his chair to digest his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well now,&rsquo; finally asked the old servant, &lsquo;what did you see at the
      Paradou? Tell us, at any rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret smiled and related in a few words how strangely Jeanbernat had
      received him. La Teuse, after overwhelming him with questions, broke out
      into indignant exclamations, while Brother Archangias clenched his fists
      and brandished them aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May Heaven crush him!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and burn both him and his witch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his turn the Abbe then endeavoured to elicit some fresh particulars
      about the people at the Paradou, and listened intently to the Brother&rsquo;s
      monstrous narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that little she-devil came and sat down in the school. It&rsquo;s a long
      time ago now, she might then have been about ten. Of course, I let her
      come; I thought her uncle was sending her to prepare for her first
      communion. But for two months she utterly revolutionised the whole class.
      She made herself worshipped, the minx! She knew all sorts of games, and
      invented all sorts of finery with leaves and shreds of rags. And how quick
      and clever she was, too, like all those children of hell! She was the top
      one at catechism. But one fine morning the old man burst in just in the
      middle of our lessons. He was going to smash everything, and shouted that
      the priests had taken his child from him. We had to get the rural
      policeman to turn him out. As to the little one, she bolted. I could see
      her through the window, in a field opposite, laughing at her uncle&rsquo;s
      frenzy. She had been coming to school for the last two months without his
      even suspecting it. He had regularly scoured the country after her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s never taken her first communion,&rsquo; exclaimed La Teuse below her
      breath with a slight shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never,&rsquo; rejoined Brother Archangias. &lsquo;She must be sixteen now. She&rsquo;s
      growing up like a brute beast. I have seen her running on all fours in a
      thicket near La Palud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On all fours,&rsquo; muttered the servant, turning towards the window with
      superstitious anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret attempted to express some doubt, but the Brother burst out:
      &lsquo;Yes, on all fours! And she jumped like a wild cat. If I had only had a
      gun I could have put a bullet in her. We kill creatures that are far more
      pleasing to God than she is. Besides, every one knows she comes
      caterwauling every night round Les Artaud. She howls like a beast. If ever
      a man should fall into her clutches, she wouldn&rsquo;t leave him a scrap of
      skin on his bones, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother&rsquo;s hatred of womankind was boiling over. He banged the table
      with his fist, and poured forth all his wonted abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil&rsquo;s in them. They reek of the devil! And that&rsquo;s what bewitches
      fools.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest nodded approvingly. Brother Archangias&rsquo;s outrageous violence
      and La Teuse&rsquo;s loquacious tyranny were like castigation with thongs, which
      it often rejoiced him to find lashing his shoulders. He took a pious
      delight in sinking into abasement beneath their coarse speech. He seemed
      to see the peace of heaven behind contempt of the world and degradation of
      his whole being. It was delicious to inflict mortification upon his body,
      to drag his susceptible nature through a gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nought but filth,&rsquo; he muttered as he folded up his napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse began to clear the table and wished to remove the plate on which
      Desiree had laid the blackbird&rsquo;s nest. You are not going to bed here, I
      suppose, mademoiselle,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Do leave those nasty things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree, however, defended her plate. She covered the nest with her bare
      arms, no longer gay, but cross at being disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope those birds are not going to be kept,&rsquo; exclaimed Brother
      Archangias. &lsquo;It would bring bad luck. You must wring their necks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he already stretched out his big hands; but the girl rose and stepped
      back quivering, hugging the nest to her bosom. She stared fixedly at the
      Brother, her lips curling upwards, like those of a wolf about to bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the little things,&rsquo; she stammered. &lsquo;You are ugly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With such singular contempt did she emphasise that last word that Abbe
      Mouret started as if the Brother&rsquo;s ugliness had just struck him for the
      first time. The latter contented himself with growling. He had always felt
      a covert hatred for Desiree, whose lusty physical development offended
      him. When she had left the room, still walking backwards, and never taking
      her eyes from him, he shrugged his shoulders and muttered between his
      teeth some coarse abuse which no one heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She had better go to bed,&rsquo; said La Teuse. &lsquo;She would only bore us
      by-and-by in church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has any one come yet?&rsquo; asked Abbe Mouret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the girls have been outside a long time with armfuls of boughs. I am
      just going to light the lamps. We can begin whenever you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later she could be heard swearing in the sacristy because
      the matches were damp. Brother Archangias, who remained alone with the
      priest, sourly inquired: &lsquo;For the month of Mary, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Abbe Mouret. &lsquo;The last few days the girls about here were
      hard at work and couldn&rsquo;t come as usual to decorate the Lady Chapel. So
      the ceremony was postponed till to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A nice custom,&rsquo; muttered the Brother. &lsquo;When I see them all putting up
      their boughs I feel inclined to knock them down and make them confess
      their misdeeds before touching the altar. It&rsquo;s a shame to allow women to
      rustle their dresses so near the holy relics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe made an apologetic gesture. He had only been at Les Artaud a
      little while, he must follow the customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whenever you like, Monsieur le Cure, we&rsquo;re ready!&rsquo; now called out La
      Teuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Brother Archangias detained him a minute. &lsquo;I am off,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;Religion isn&rsquo;t a prostitute that it should be decorated with flowers and
      laces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly to the door. Then once more he stopped, and lifting one
      of his hairy fingers added: &lsquo;Beware of your devotion to the Virgin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0016" id="link2H_4_0016">

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the church Abbe Mouret found nine or ten big girls awaiting
      him with boughs of ivy, laurel, and rosemary. Few garden flowers grew on
      the rocks of Les Artaud, so the custom was to decorate the Lady altar with
      a greenery which might last throughout the month of May. Thereto La Teuse
      would add a few wallflowers whose stems were thrust into old decanters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me do it, Monsieur le Cure?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;You are not used to
      it&mdash;&mdash; Come, stand there in front of the altar. You can tell me
      if the decorations please you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He consented, and it was she who really directed the arrangements. Having
      climbed upon a pair of steps she bullied the girls as they came up to her
      in turn with their leafy contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so fast, now! You must give me time to fix the boughs. We can&rsquo;t have
      all these bundles coming down on his reverence&rsquo;s head&mdash;&mdash; Come
      on, Babet, it&rsquo;s your turn. What&rsquo;s the good of staring at me like that with
      your big eyes? Fine rosemary yours is, my word! as yellow as a thistle.
      You next, La Rousse. Ah, well, that is splendid laurel! You got that out
      of your field at Croix-Verte, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The big girls laid their branches on the altar, which they kissed; and
      there they lingered for a while, handing up the greenery to La Teuse. The
      sly look of devotion they had assumed on stepping on to the altar steps
      was quickly set aside, and soon they were laughing, digging each other
      with their knees, swaying their hips against the altar&rsquo;s edge, and
      thrusting their bosoms against the tabernacle itself. Over them the tall
      Virgin in gilded plaster bent her tinted face, and smiled with her rosy
      lips upon the naked Jesus she bore upon her left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, Lisa!&rsquo; cried La Teuse; &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you sit on the altar while
      you&rsquo;re about it? Just pull your petticoats straight, will you? Aren&rsquo;t you
      ashamed of behaving like that?&mdash;If any one of you lolls about I&rsquo;ll
      lay her boughs across her face.&mdash;Can&rsquo;t you hand me the things
      quietly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning round, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you like it, sir? Do you think it will do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had converted the space behind the Virgin&rsquo;s statue into a verdant
      niche, whence leafy sprays projected on either side, forming a bower, and
      drooping over in front like palm leaves. The priest expressed his
      approval, but ventured to remark: &lsquo;I think there ought to be a cluster of
      more delicate foliage up above.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; grumbled La Teuse. &lsquo;But they only bring me laurel and rosemary&mdash;I
      should like to know who has brought an olive branch. Not one, you bet!
      They are afraid of losing a single olive, the heathens!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, however, Catherine came up laden with an enormous olive bough
      which completely hid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got some, you minx!&rsquo; continued the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; one of the other girls exclaimed, &lsquo;she stole it. I saw
      Vincent breaking it off while she kept a look-out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Catherine flew into a rage and swore it was not true. She turned, and
      thrusting her auburn head through the greenery, which she still tightly
      held, she started lying with marvellous assurance, inventing quite a long
      story to prove that the olive bough was really hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;all the trees belong to the Blessed Virgin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret was about to intervene, but La Teuse sharply inquired if they
      wanted to make game of her and keep her arms up there all night. At last
      she proceeded to fasten the olive bough firmly, while Catherine, holding
      on to the steps behind her, mimicked the clumsy manner in which she turned
      her huge person about with the help of her sound leg. Even the priest
      could not forbear to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said La Teuse, as she came down and stood beside him to get a
      good view of her work, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s the top done. Now we will put some clumps
      between the candlesticks, unless you would prefer a garland all along the
      altar shelf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest decided in favour of some big clumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good; come on, then,&rsquo; continued the old servant, once more
      clambering up the steps. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go to bed here. Just kiss the altar,
      will you, Miette? Do you fancy you are in your stable? Monsieur le Cure,
      do just see what they are up to over there! I can hear them laughing like
      lunatics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On raising one of the two lamps the dark end of the church was lit up and
      three of the girls were discovered romping about under the gallery; one of
      them had stumbled and pitched head foremost into the holy water stoup,
      which mishap had so tickled the others that they were rolling on the
      ground to laugh at their ease. They all came back, however, looking at the
      priest sheepishly, with lowered eyelids, but with their hands swinging
      against their hips as if a scolding rather pleased them than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the measure of La Teuse&rsquo;s wrath was filled when she suddenly
      perceived Rosalie coming up to the altar like the others with a bundle of
      boughs in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get down, will you?&rsquo; she cried to her. &lsquo;You are a cool one, and no
      mistake, my lass!&mdash;Hurry up, off you go with your bundle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rsquo; said Rosalie boldly. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t say I have
      stolen it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other girls drew closer, feigning innocence and exchanging sparkling
      glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clear out,&rsquo; repeated La Teuse, &lsquo;you have no business here, do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite losing her scanty patience, she gave vent to a very coarse
      epithet, which provoked a titter of delight among the peasant girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what next?&rsquo; said Rosalie. &lsquo;Mind your own business. Is it any
      concern of yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she burst into a fit of sobbing and threw down her boughs, but let
      the Abbe lead her aside and give her a severe lecture. He had already
      tried to silence La Teuse; for he was beginning to feel uneasy amidst the
      big shameless hussies who filled the church with their armfuls of foliage.
      They were pushing right up to the altar step, enclosing him with a belt of
      woodland, wafting in his face a rank perfume of aromatic shoots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us make haste, be quick!&rsquo; he exclaimed, clapping his hands lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness knows I would rather be in my bed,&rsquo; grumbled La Teuse. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not
      so easy as you think to fasten all these bits of stuff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, however, she succeeded in setting some lofty plumes of foliage
      between the candlesticks. Next she folded the steps, which were laid
      behind the high altar by Catherine. And then she only had to arrange two
      clumps of greenery at the sides of the altar table. The last boughs
      sufficed for this, and indeed there were some left which the girls strewed
      over the sanctuary floor up to the wooden rails. The Lady altar now looked
      like a grove, a shrubbery with a verdant lawn before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present La Teuse was willing to make way for Abbe Mouret, who ascended
      the altar steps, and, again lightly clapping his hands, exclaimed: &lsquo;Young
      ladies, to-morrow we will continue the devotions of the month of Mary.
      Those who may be unable to come ought at least to say their Rosary at
      home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt, and the peasant girls, with a mighty rustle of skirts, sank down
      and settled themselves on their heels. They followed his prayer with a
      confused muttering, through which burst here and there a giggle. One of
      them, on being pinched from behind, burst into a scream, which she
      attempted to stifle with a sudden fit of coughing; and this so diverted
      the others that for a moment after the Amen they remained writhing with
      merriment, their noses close to the stone flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse dismissed them; while the priest, after crossing himself,
      remained absorbed before the altar, no longer hearing what went on behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, now, clear out,&rsquo; muttered the old woman. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a pack of
      good-for-nothings, who can&rsquo;t even respect God. It&rsquo;s shameful, it&rsquo;s unheard
      of, for girls to roll about on the floor in church like beasts in a meadow&mdash;&mdash;
      What are you doing there, La Rousse? If I see you pinching any one, you&rsquo;ll
      have to deal with me! Oh, yes, you may put out your tongue at me; I&rsquo;ll
      tell his reverence about it. Out you get; out you get, you minxes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove them slowly towards the door, while running and bobbling round
      them frantically. And she had succeeded, as she thought, in getting every
      one of them outside, when she caught sight of Catherine and Vincent calmly
      installed in the confessional, where they were eating something with an
      air of great enjoyment. She drove them away; and as she popped her head
      outside the church, before closing the door, she espied Rosalie throwing
      her arm over the shoulder of Fortune, who had been waiting for her. The
      pair of them vanished in the darkness amid a faint sound of kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To think that such creatures dare to come to our Lady&rsquo;s altar!&rsquo; La Teuse
      stuttered as she shot the bolts. &lsquo;The others are no better, I am sure. If
      they came to-night with their boughs, it was only for a bit of fun and to
      get kissed by the lads on going off! Not one of them will put herself out
      of the way to-morrow; his reverence will have to say his <i>Aves</i> by
      himself&mdash;&mdash; We shall only see the jades who have got
      assignations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus soliloquising, she thrust the chairs back into their places, and
      looked round to see if anything suspicious was lying about before going
      off to bed. In the confessional she picked up a handful of apple-parings,
      which she threw behind the high altar. And she also found a bit of ribbon
      torn from some cap, and a lock of black hair, which she made up into a
      small parcel, with the view of opening an inquiry into the matter. With
      these exceptions the church seemed to her tidy. There was oil enough for
      the night in the bracket-lamp of the sanctuary, and as to the flags of the
      choir, they could do without washing till Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly ten o&rsquo;clock, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; she said, drawing near the
      priest, who was still on his knees. &lsquo;You might as well come up now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but only bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, I know what that means,&rsquo; continued La Teuse. &lsquo;In another hour
      he will still be on the stones there, giving himself a stomach-ache. I&rsquo;m
      off, as I shall only bore him. All the same, I can&rsquo;t see much sense in it,
      eating one&rsquo;s lunch when others are at dinner, and going to bed when the
      fowls get up!&mdash;&mdash; I worry you, don&rsquo;t I, your reverence?
      Good-night. You&rsquo;re not at all reasonable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made ready to go, but suddenly came back to put out one of the two
      lamps, muttering the while that such late prayers spelt ruination in oil.
      Then, at last, she did go off, after passing her sleeve brushwise over the
      cloth of the high altar, which seemed to her grey with dust. Abbe Mouret,
      his eyes uplifted, his arms tightly clasped against his breast, then
      remained alone.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      With only one lamp burning amid the verdure on the altar of the Virgin,
      huge floating shadows filled the church at either end. From the pulpit a
      sheet of gloom projected to the rafters of the ceiling. The confessional
      looked quite black under the gallery, showing strange outlines suggestive
      of a ruined sentry-box. All the light, softened and tinted as it were by
      the green foliage, rested slumberingly upon the tall gilded Virgin, who
      seemed to descend with queenly mien, borne upon the cloud round which
      gambolled the winged cherubim. At sight of that round lamp gleaming amid
      the boughs one might have thought the pallid moon was rising on the verge
      of a wood, casting its light upon a regal apparition, a princess of
      heaven, crowned and clothed with gold, who with her nude and Divine Infant
      had come to stroll in the mysterious woodland avenues. Between the leaves,
      along the lofty plumes of greenery, within the large ogival arbour, and
      even along the branches strewing the flagstones, star-like beams glided
      drowsily, like the milky rain of light that filters through the bushes on
      moonlit nights. Vague sounds and creakings came from the dusky ends of the
      church; the large clock on the left of the chancel throbbed slowly, with
      the heavy breathing of a machine asleep. And the radiant vision, the
      Mother with slender bands of chestnut hair, as if reassured by the
      nocturnal quiet of the nave, came lower and lower, scarce bending the
      blades of grass in the clearings beneath the gentle flight of her cloudy
      chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret gazed at her. This was the hour when he most loved the church.
      He forgot the woeful figure on the cross, the Victim bedaubed with carmine
      and ochre, who gasped out His life behind him, in the chapel of the Dead.
      His thoughts were no longer distracted by the garish light from the
      windows, by the gayness of morning coming in with the sun, by the
      irruption of outdoor life&mdash;the sparrows and the boughs invading the
      nave through the shattered panes. At that hour of night Nature was dead;
      shadows hung the whitewashed walls with crape; a chill fell upon his
      shoulders like a salutary penance-shirt. He could now wholly surrender
      himself to the supremest love, without fear of any flickering ray of
      light, any caressing breeze or scent, any buzzing of an insect&rsquo;s wing
      disturbing him amidst the delight of loving. Never had his morning mass
      afforded him the superhuman joys of his nightly prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With quivering lips Abbe Mouret now gazed at the tall Virgin. He could see
      her coming towards him from the depths of her green bower in
      ever-increasing splendour. No longer did a flood of moonlight seem to
      float across the tree-tops. She seemed to him clothed with the sun; she
      advanced majestically, glorious, colossal, and so all-powerful that he was
      tempted at times to cast himself face downwards to shun the flaming
      splendour of that gate opening into heaven. Then, amidst the adoration of
      his whole being, which stayed his words upon his lips, he remembered
      Brother Archangias&rsquo;s final rebuke, as he might have remembered words of
      blasphemy. The Brother often reproved him for his devotion to the Virgin,
      which he declared was veritable robbery of devotion due to God. In the
      Brother&rsquo;s opinion it enervated the soul, put religion into petticoats,
      created and fostered a state of sentimentalism quite unworthy of the
      strong. He bore the Virgin a grudge for her womanhood, her beauty, her
      maternity; he was ever on his guard against her, possessed by a covert
      fear of feeling tempted by her gracious mien, of succumbing to her
      seductive sweetness. &lsquo;She will lead you far!&rsquo; he had cried one day to the
      young priest, for in her he saw the commencement of human passion. From
      contemplating her one might glide to delight in lovely chestnut hair, in
      large bright eyes, and the mystery of garments falling from neck to toes.
      His was the blunt rebellion of a saint who roughly parted the Mother from
      the Son, asking as He did: &lsquo;Woman, what have we in common, thou and I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abbe Mouret thrust away such thoughts, prostrated himself, endeavoured
      to forget the Brother&rsquo;s harsh attacks. His rapture in the immaculate
      purity of Mary alone raised him from the depths of lowliness in which he
      sought to bury himself. Whenever, alone before the tall golden Virgin, he
      so deceived himself as to imagine that he could see her bending down for
      him to kiss her braided locks, he once more became very young, very good,
      very strong, very just, full of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s devotion to the Virgin dated from his early youth. Already
      when he was quite a child, somewhat shy and fond of shrinking into
      corners, he took pleasure in the thought that a lovely lady was watching
      over him: that two blue eyes, so sweet, ever followed him with their
      smile. When he felt at night a breath of air glide across his hair, he
      would often say that the Virgin had come to kiss him. He had grown up
      beneath this womanly caress, in an atmosphere full of the rustle of divine
      robes. From the age of seven he had satisfied the cravings of his
      affection by expending all the pence he received as pocket money in the
      purchase of pious picture-cards, which he jealously concealed that he
      alone might feast on them. But never was he tempted by the pictures of
      Jesus and the Lamb, of Christ on the Cross, of God the Father, with a
      mighty beard, stooping over a bank of clouds; his preference was always
      for the winning portraits of Mary, with her tiny smiling mouth and
      delicate outstretched hands. By degrees he had made quite a collection of
      them all&mdash;of Mary between a lily and a distaff, Mary carrying her
      child as if she were his elder sister, Mary crowned with roses, and Mary
      crowned with stars. For him they formed a family of lovely young maidens,
      alike in their attractiveness, in the grace, kindliness, and sweetness of
      their countenances, so youthful beneath their veils, that although they
      bore the name of &lsquo;Mother of God,&rsquo; he had felt no awe of them as he had
      often felt for grown-up persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to him of his own age, little girls such as he wished to meet
      with, little girls of heaven such as the little boys who die when seven
      years old have for eternal playmates in some nook of Paradise. But even at
      this early age he was self-contained; and full of the exquisite
      bashfulness of adolescence he grew up without betraying the secret of his
      religious love. Mary grew up with him, being invariably a year or two
      older than himself, as should always be the case with one&rsquo;s chiefest
      friend. When he was eighteen, she was twenty; she no longer kissed his
      forehead at night time, but stood a little further from him with folded
      arms, chastely smiling, ravishingly sweet. And he&mdash;he only named her
      now in a whisper, feeling as if he would faint each time the well-loved
      name passed his lips in prayer. No more did he dream of childish games
      within the garden of heaven, but of continual contemplation before that
      white figure, whose perfect purity he feared to sully with his breath.
      Even from his own mother did he conceal the fervour of his love for Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a few years later, at the seminary, his beautiful affection for her,
      seemingly so just, so natural, was disturbed by inward qualms. Was the
      cult of Mary necessary for salvation? Was he not robbing God by giving
      Mary a part, the greater part, of his love, his thoughts, his heart, his
      entire being? Perplexing questions were these, provoking an inward
      struggle which increased his passion, riveted his bonds. For he dived into
      all the subtleties of his affection, found unknown joys in discussing the
      lawfulness of his feelings. The books treating of devotion to the Virgin
      brought him excuses, joyful raptures, a wealth of arguments which he
      repeated with prayerful fervour. From them he learned how, in Mary, to be
      the slave of Jesus. He went to Jesus through Mary. He cited all kinds of
      proofs, he discriminated, he drew inferences. Mary, whom Jesus had obeyed
      on earth, should be obeyed by all mankind; Mary still retained her
      maternal power in heaven, where she was the great dispenser of God&rsquo;s
      treasures, the only one who could beseech Him, the only one who allotted
      the heavenly thrones; and thus Mary, a mere creature before God, but
      raised up to Him, became the human link between heaven and earth, the
      intermediary of every grace, of every mercy; and his conclusion always was
      that she should be loved above all else in God himself. Another time he
      was attracted by more complicated theological curiosities: the marriage of
      the celestial spouse, the Holy Ghost sealing the Vase of Election, making
      of the Virgin Mary an everlasting miracle, offering her inviolable purity
      to the devotion of mankind. She was the Virgin overcoming all heresies,
      the irreconcilable foe of Satan, the new Eve of whom it had been foretold
      that she should crush the Serpent&rsquo;s head, the august Gate of Grace, by
      which the Saviour had already entered once and through which He would come
      again at the Last Day&mdash;a vague prophecy, allotting a yet larger
      future role to Mary, which threw Serge into a dreamy imagining of some
      immense expansion of divine love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This entry of woman into the jealous, cruel heaven depicted by the Old
      Testament, this figure of whiteness set at the feet of the awesome
      Trinity, appeared to him the very grace itself of religion, the one
      consolation for all the dread inspired by things of faith, the one refuge
      when he found himself lost amidst the mysteries of dogma. And when he had
      thus proved to himself, point by point, that she was the way to Jesus&mdash;easy,
      short, perfect, and certain&mdash;he surrendered himself anew to her,
      wholly and without remorse: he strove to be her true devotee, dead to self
      and steeped in submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an hour of divine voluptuousness! The books treating of devotion to
      the Virgin burned his hands. They spoke to him in a language of love,
      warm, fragrant as incense. Mary no longer seemed a young maiden veiled in
      white, standing with crossed arms, a foot or two away from his pillow. She
      came surrounded by splendour, even as John saw her, clothed with the sun,
      crowned with twelve stars, and having the moon beneath her feet. She
      perfumed him with her fragrance, inflamed him with longing for heaven,
      ravished him even with the ardent glow of the planets flaming on her brow.
      He threw himself before her and called himself her slave. No word could
      have been sweeter than that word of slave, which he repeated, which he
      relished yet more and more as it trembled on his stammering tongue, whilst
      casting himself at her feet&mdash;to become her thing, her mite, the dust
      lightly scattered by the waving of her azure robe. With David he
      exclaimed: &lsquo;Mary is made for me,&rsquo; and with the Evangelist he added: &lsquo;I
      have taken her for my all.&rsquo; He called her his &lsquo;beloved mistress,&rsquo; for
      words failed him, and he fell into the prattle of child or lover, his
      breath breaking with intensity of passion. She was the Blessed among
      women, the Queen of Heaven glorified by the nine Choirs of Angels, the
      Mother of Predilection, the Treasure of the Lord. All the vivid imagery of
      her cult unrolled itself before him comparing to her an earthly paradise
      of virgin soil, with beds of flowering virtues, green meadows of hope,
      impregnable towers of strength, and smiling dwellings of confidence. Again
      she was a fountain sealed by the Holy Ghost, a shrine and dwelling-place
      of the Holy Trinity, the Throne of God, the City of God, the Altar of God,
      the Temple of God, and the World of God. And he walked in that garden, in
      its shade, its sunlight, beneath its enchanting greenery; he sighed after
      the water of that Fountain; he dwelt within Mary&rsquo;s beauteous precincts&mdash;resting,
      hiding, heedlessly straying there, drinking in the milk of infinite love
      that fell drop by drop from her virginal bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning, on rising at the seminary, he greeted Mary with a hundred
      bows, his face turned towards the strip of sky visible from his window.
      And at night in like fashion he bade her farewell with his eyes fixed upon
      the stars. Often, when he thus gazed out on fine bright nights, when Venus
      gleamed golden and dreamy through the warm atmosphere, he forgot himself,
      and then, like a soft song, would fall from his lips the <i>Ave maris
      Stella</i>, that tender hymn which set before his eyes a distant azure
      land, and a tranquil sea, scarce wrinkled by a caressing quiver, and
      illuminated by a smiling star, a very sun in size. He recited, too, the <i>Salve
      Regina</i>, the <i>Regina Coeli</i>, the <i>O gloriosa Domina</i>, all the
      prayers and all the canticles. He would read the Office of the Virgin, the
      holy books written in her honour, the little Psalter of St. Bonaventura,
      with such devout tenderness, that he could not turn the leaves for tears.
      He fasted and mortified himself, that he might offer up to her his bruised
      and wounded flesh. Ever since the age of ten he had worn her livery&mdash;the
      holy scapular, the twofold image of Mary sewn on squares of cloth, whose
      warmth upon his chest and back thrilled him with delight. Later on, he
      also took to wearing the little chain in token of his loving slavery. But
      his greatest act of love was ever the Angelic Salutation, the <i>Ave Maria</i>,
      his heart&rsquo;s perfect prayer. &lsquo;Hail, Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and he saw her
      advancing towards him, full of grace, blessed amongst women; and he cast
      his heart at her feet for her to tread on it in sweetness. He multiplied
      and repeated that salutation in a hundred different ways, ever seeking
      some more efficacious one. He would say twelve <i>Aves</i> to commemorate
      the crown of twelve stars that encircled Mary&rsquo;s brow; he would say
      fourteen in remembrance of her fourteen joys; at another time he would
      recite seven decades of them in honour of the years she lived on earth.
      For hours the beads of his Rosary would glide between his fingers. Then,
      again, on certain days of mystical assignation he would launch into the
      endless muttering of the Rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, alone in his cell, with time to give to his love, he knelt upon the
      floor, the whole of Mary&rsquo;s garden with its lofty flowers of chastity
      blossomed around him. Between his fingers glided the Rosary&rsquo;s wreath of <i>Aves</i>,
      intersected by <i>Paters</i>, like a garland of white roses mingled with
      the lilies of the Annunciation, the blood-hued flowers of Calvary, and the
      stars of the Coronation. He would slowly tread those fragrant paths,
      pausing at each of the fifteen dizains of <i>Aves</i>, and dwelling on its
      corresponding mystery; he was beside himself with joy, or grief, or
      triumph, according as the mystery belonged to one or other of the three
      series&mdash;the joyful, the sorrowful, or the glorious. What an
      incomparable legend it was, the history of Mary, a complete human life,
      with all its smiles and tears and triumph, which he lived over again from
      end to end in a single moment! And first he entered into joy with the five
      glad Mysteries, steeped in the serene calm of dawn. First the Archangel&rsquo;s
      salutation, the fertilising ray gliding down from heaven, fraught with the
      spotless union&rsquo;s adorable ecstasy; then the visit to Elizabeth on a bright
      hope-laden morn, when the fruit of Mary&rsquo;s womb for the first time stirred
      and thrilled her with the shock at which mothers blench; then the birth in
      a stable at Bethlehem, and the long string of shepherds coming to pay
      homage to her Divine Maternity; then the new-born babe carried into the
      Temple on the arms of his mother who smiled, still weary, but already
      happy at offering her child to God&rsquo;s justice, to Simeon&rsquo;s embrace, to the
      desires of the world; and lastly, Jesus at a later age revealing Himself
      before the doctors, in whose midst He is found by His anxious mother, now
      proud and comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after that tender radiant dawn, it seemed to Serge as if the sky were
      suddenly overcast. His feet now trod on brambles, the beads of the Rosary
      pricked his fingers; he cowered beneath the horror of the five Sorrowful
      Mysteries: Mary, agonising in her Son in the garden of Olives, suffering
      with Him from the scourging, feeling on her own brow the wounds made by
      the crown of thorns, bearing the fearful weight of His Cross, and dying at
      his feet on Calvary. Those inevitable sufferings, that harrowing martyrdom
      of the queen he worshipped, and for whom he would have shed his blood like
      Jesus, roused in him a feeling of shuddering repulsion which ten years&rsquo; 
      practice of the same prayers and the same devotions had failed to weaken.
      But as the beads flowed on, light suddenly burst upon the darkness of the
      Crucifixion, and the resplendent glory of the five last Mysteries shone
      forth in all the brightness of a cloudless sun. Mary was transfigured, and
      sang the hallelujah of the Resurrection, the victory over Death and the
      eternity of life. With outstretched hands, and dazed with admiration, she
      beheld the triumph of her Son ascending into heaven on golden clouds,
      fringed with purple. She gathered the Apostles round her, and, as on the
      day of her conception, participated in the glow of the Spirit of Love,
      descending now in tongues of fire. She, too, was carried up to heaven by a
      flight of angels, borne aloft on their white wings like a spotless ark,
      and tenderly set down amid the splendour of the heavenly thrones; and
      there, in her supreme glory, amidst a splendour so dazzling that the light
      of the sun was quenched, God crowned her with the stars of the firmament.
      Impassioned love has but one word. In reciting a hundred and fifty <i>Aves</i>
      Serge had not once repeated himself. The monotonous murmur, the ever
      recurring words, akin to the &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; of lovers, assumed each time a
      deeper and deeper meaning; and he lingered over it all, expressed
      everything with the aid of the one solitary Latin sentence, and learned to
      know Mary through and through, until, as the last bead of his Rosary
      slipped from his hand, his heart grew faint with the thought of parting
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a night had the young man spent in this way. Daybreak had found him
      still murmuring his prayers. It was the moon, he would say to cheat
      himself, that was making the stars wane. His superiors had to reprove him
      for those vigils, which left him languid and pale as if he had been losing
      blood. On the wall of his cell had long hung a coloured engraving of the
      Sacred Heart of Mary, an engraving which showed the Virgin smiling
      placidly, throwing open her bodice, and revealing a crimson fissure,
      wherein glowed her heart, pierced with a sword, and crowned with white
      roses. That sword tormented him beyond measure, brought him an intolerable
      horror of suffering in woman, the very thought of which scattered his
      pious submissiveness to the winds. He erased the weapon, and left only the
      crowned and flaming heart which seemed to be half torn from that exquisite
      flesh, as if tendered as an offering to himself. And it was then he felt
      beloved: Mary was giving him her heart, her living heart, even as it
      throbbed in her bosom, dripping with her rosy blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this there was no longer the imagery of devout passion, but a
      material entity, a prodigy of affection which impelled him, when he was
      praying before the engraving, to open out his hands in order that he might
      reverently receive the heart that leaped from that immaculate bosom. He
      could see it, hear it beat; he was loved, that heart was beating for
      himself! His whole being quickened with rapture; he would fain have kissed
      that heart, have melted in it, have lain beside it within the depths of
      that open breast. Mary&rsquo;s love for him was an active one; she desired him
      to be near her, to be wholly hers in the eternity to come; her love was
      efficacious, too, she was ever solicitous for him, watching over him
      everywhere, guarding him from the slightest breach of his fidelity. She
      loved him tenderly, more than the whole of womankind together, with a love
      as azure, as deep, as boundless as the sky itself. Where could he ever
      find so delightful a mistress? What earthly caress could be compared to
      the air in which he moved, the breath of Mary? What mundane union or
      enjoyment could be weighed against that everlasting flower of desire which
      grew unceasingly, and yet was never over-blown? At this thought the <i>Magnificat</i>
      would exhale from his mouth, like a cloud of incense. He sang the joyful
      song of Mary, her thrill of joy at the approach of her Divine Spouse. He
      glorified the Lord who overthrew the mighty from their thrones, and who
      sent Mary to him, poor destitute child that he was, dying of love on the
      cold tiled floor of his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he had given all up to Mary&mdash;his body, his soul, his earthly
      goods, and spiritual chattels&mdash;when he stood before her stripped,
      bare, with all his prayers exhausted, there welled from his burning lips
      the Virgin&rsquo;s litanies, with their reiterated, persistent, impassioned
      appeals for heavenly succour. He fancied himself climbing a flight of
      pious yearnings, which he ascended step by step at each bound of his
      heart. First he called her &lsquo;Holy.&rsquo; Next he called her &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; most pure,
      most chaste, amiable, and admirable. And with fresh ardour he six times
      proclaimed her maidenhood; his lips cooled and freshened each time that he
      pronounced that name of &lsquo;Virgin,&rsquo; which he coupled with power, goodness,
      and fidelity. And as his heart drew him higher up the ladder of light, a
      strange voice from his veins spoke within him, bursting into dazzling
      flowers of speech. He yearned to melt away in fragrance, to be spread
      around in light, to expire in a sigh of music. As he named her &lsquo;Mirror of
      Justice,&rsquo; &lsquo;Seat of Wisdom,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Source of Joy,&rsquo; he could behold himself
      pale with ecstasy in that mirror, kneeling on the warmth of the divine
      seat, quaffing intoxication in mighty draughts from the holy Source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he would transform her, throwing off all restraint in his frantic
      love, so as to attain to a yet closer union with her. She became a &lsquo;Vessel
      of Honour,&rsquo; chosen of God, a &lsquo;Bosom of Election,&rsquo; wherein he desired to
      pour his being, and slumber for ever.* She was the &lsquo;Mystical Rose&rsquo;&mdash;a
      great flower which bloomed in Paradise, with petals formed of the angels
      clustering round their queen, a flower so fresh, so fragrant, that he
      could inhale its perfume from the depths of his unworthiness with a joyful
      dilation of his sides which stretched them to bursting. She became changed
      into a &lsquo;House of Gold,&rsquo; a &lsquo;Tower of David,&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Tower of Ivory,&rsquo; of
      inestimable richness, of a whiteness that swans might envy, and of lofty,
      massive, rounded form, which he would fain have encircled with his
      outstretched arms as with a girdle of submissiveness. She stood on the
      distant skyline as the &lsquo;Gate of Heaven,&rsquo; a glimpse of which he caught
      behind her shoulders when a puff of wind threw back the folds of her veil.
      She rose in splendour from behind the mountain in the waning hour of
      night, like the &lsquo;Morning Star&rsquo; to help all travellers astray, like the
      very dawn of Love. And when he had ascended to this height&mdash;scant of
      breath, yet still unsatiated&mdash;he could only further glorify her with
      the title of &lsquo;Queen,&rsquo; with which he nine times hailed her, as with nine
      parting salutations from the censer of his soul. His canticle died
      joyfully away in those last ejaculations of triumph: &lsquo;Queen of virgins,
      Queen of all saints. Queen conceived without sin!&rsquo; She, ever before him,
      shone in splendour; and he, on the topmost step, only reached by Mary&rsquo;s
      intimates, remained there yet another moment, swooning amidst the subtle
      atmosphere around him; still too far away to kiss the edge of her azure
      robe, already feeling that he was about to fall, but ever possessed by a
      desire to ascend again and again, and seek that superhuman felicity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * Curiously enough I find no trace of &lsquo;Bosom of Election&rsquo; in the
    Litany of the Blessed Virgin as printed in English Catholic
    works.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      How many times had not the Litany of the Virgin, recited in common in the
      seminary chapel, left the young man with broken limbs and void head, as if
      from some great fall! And since his departure from the seminary, Abbe
      Mouret had grown to love the Virgin still more. He gave to her that
      impassioned cult which to Brother Archangias savoured of heresy. In his
      opinion it was she who would save the Church by some matchless prodigy
      whose near appearance would entrance the world. She was the only miracle
      of our impious age&mdash;the blue-robed lady that showed herself to little
      shepherdesses, the whiteness that gleamed at night between two clouds, her
      veil trailing over the low thatched roofs of peasant homes. When Brother
      Archangias coarsely asked him if he had ever espied her, he simply smiled
      and tightened his lips as if to keep his secret. Truth to say, he saw her
      every night. She no longer seemed a playful sister or a lovely pious
      maiden; she wore a bridal robe, with white flowers in her hair; and from
      beneath her drooping eyelids fell moist glances of hopeful promise that
      set his cheeks aglow. He could feel that she was coming, that she was
      promising to delay no longer; that she said to him, &lsquo;Here I am, receive
      me!&rsquo; Thrice a day when the <i>Angelus</i> rang out&mdash;at break of dawn,
      in the fulness of midday, and at the gentle fall of twilight&mdash;he
      bared his head and said an <i>Ave</i> with a glance around him as if to
      ascertain whether the bell were not at last announcing Mary&rsquo;s coming. He
      was five-and-twenty. He awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of May the young priest&rsquo;s expectation was fraught with
      joyful hope. To La Teuse&rsquo;s grumblings he no longer paid the slightest
      attention. If he remained so late praying in the church, it was because he
      entertained the mad idea that the great golden Virgin would at last come
      down from her pedestal. And yet he stood in awe of that Virgin, so like a
      princess in her mien. He did not love all the Virgins alike, and this one
      inspired him with supreme respect. She was, indeed, the Mother of God, she
      showed the fertile development of form, the majestic countenance, the
      strong arms of the Divine Spouse bearing Jesus. He pictured her thus,
      standing in the midst of the heavenly court, the train of her royal mantle
      trailing among the stars; so far above him, and of such exceeding might,
      that he would be shattered into dust should she deign to cast her eyes
      upon him. She was the Virgin of his days of weakness, the austere Virgin
      who restored his inward peace by an awesome glimpse of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Abbe Mouret remained for over an hour on his knees in the empty
      church. With folded hands and eyes fixed on the golden Virgin rising
      planet-like amid the verdure, he sought the drowsiness of ecstasy, the
      appeasement of the strange discomfort he had felt that day. But he failed
      to find the semi-somnolence of prayer with the delightful ease he knew so
      well. However glorious and pure Mary might reveal herself, her motherhood,
      the maturity of her charms, and the bare infant she bore upon her arm,
      disquieted him. It seemed as if in heaven itself there were a repetition
      of the exuberant life, through which he had been moving since the morning.
      Like the vines of the stony slopes, like the trees of the Paradou, like
      the human troop of Artauds, Mary suggested the blossoming, the begetting
      of life. Prayer came but slowly to his lips; fancies made his mind wander.
      He perceived things he had never seen before&mdash;the gentle wave of her
      chestnut hair, the rounded swell of her rosy throat. She had to assume a
      sterner air and overwhelm him with the splendour of her sovereign power to
      bring him back to the unfinished sentences of his broken prayer. At last
      the sight of her golden crown, her golden mantle, all the golden sheen
      which made of her a mighty princess, reduced him once more to slavish
      submission, and his prayer again flowed evenly, and his mind became
      wrapped in worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this ecstatic trance, half asleep, half awake, he remained till eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, heedless of his aching knees, fancying himself suspended in mid
      air, rocked to and fro like a child, and yielding to restful slumber,
      though conscious of some unknown weight that oppressed his heart.
      Meanwhile the church around him filled with shadows, the lamp grew dim,
      and the lofty sprays of leafage darkened the tall Virgin&rsquo;s varnished face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clock, about to strike, gave out a rending whine, a shudder
      passed through Abbe Mouret. He had not hitherto felt the chill of the
      church upon his shoulders, but now he was shivering from head to foot. As
      he crossed himself a memory swiftly flashed through the stupor of his
      wakening&mdash;the chattering of his teeth recalled to him the nights he
      had spent on the floor of his cell before the Sacred Heart of Mary, when
      his whole frame would quiver with fever. He rose up painfully, displeased
      with himself. As a rule, he would leave the altar untroubled in his flesh
      and with Mary&rsquo;s sweet breath still fresh upon his brow. That night,
      however, as he took the lamp to go up to his room he felt as if his
      throbbing temples were bursting. His prayer had not profited him; after a
      transient alleviation he still experienced the burning glow which had been
      rising in his heart and brain since morning. When he reached the sacristy
      door, he turned and mechanically raised the lamp to take a last look at
      the tall Virgin. But she was now shrouded in the deep shadows falling from
      the rafters, buried in the foliage around her whence only the golden cross
      upon her crown emerged.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s bedroom, which occupied a corner of the vicarage, was a
      spacious one, having two large square windows; one of which opened above
      Desiree&rsquo;s farmyard, whilst the other overlooked the village, the valley
      beyond, the belt of hills, the whole landscape. The yellow-curtained bed,
      the walnut chest of drawers, and the three straw-bottomed chairs seemed
      lost below that lofty ceiling with whitewashed joists. A faint tartness,
      the somewhat musty odour of old country houses, ascended from the tiled
      and ruddled floor that glistened like a mirror. On the chest of drawers a
      tall statuette of the Immaculate Conception rose greyly between some
      porcelain vases which La Teuse had filled with white lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret set his lamp on the edge of the chest of drawers before the
      Virgin. He felt so unwell that he determined to light the vine-stem fire
      which was laid in readiness. He stood there, tongs in hand, watching the
      kindling wood, his face illuminated by the flame. The house beneath
      slumbered in unbroken stillness. The silence filled his ears with a hum,
      which grew into a sound of whispering voices. Slowly and irresistibly
      these voices mastered him and increased the feeling of anxiety which had
      almost choked him several times that day. What could be the cause of such
      mental anguish? What could be the strange trouble which had slowly grown
      within him and had now become so unbearable? He had not fallen into sin.
      It seemed as if but yesterday he had left the seminary with all his ardent
      faith, and so fortified against the world that he moved among men
      beholding God alone. And, suddenly, he fancied himself in his cell at five
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the hour for rising. The deacon on duty passed his
      door, striking it with his stick, and repeating the regulation summons&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Benedicamus Domino</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Deo gratias</i>!&rsquo; he answered half asleep, with his eyes still swollen
      with slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he jumped out upon his strip of carpet, washed himself, made his bed,
      swept his room, and refilled his little pitcher. He enjoyed this petty
      domestic work while the morning air sent a thrilling shiver throughout his
      frame. He could hear the sparrows in the plane-trees of the court-yard,
      rising at the same time as himself with a deafening noise of wings and
      notes&mdash;their way of saying their prayers, thought he. Then he went
      down to the meditation room, and stayed there on his knees for half an
      hour after prayers, to con that reflection of St. Ignatius: &lsquo;What profit
      be it to a man to gain the whole world if he lose his soul?&rsquo; A subject,
      this, fertile in good resolutions, which impelled him to renounce all
      earthly goods, and dwell on that fond dream of a desert life, beneath the
      solitary wealth and luxury of a vast blue sky. When ten minutes had
      passed, his bruised knees became so painful that his whole being slowly
      swooned into ecstasy, in which he pictured himself as a mighty conqueror,
      the master of an immense empire, flinging down his crown, breaking his
      sceptre, trampling under foot unheard-of wealth, chests of gold, floods of
      jewels, and rich stuffs embroidered with precious stones, before going to
      bury himself in some Thebais, clothed in rough drugget that rasped his
      back. Mass, however, snatched him from these heated fancies, upon which he
      looked back as upon some beautiful reality which might have been his lot
      in ancient times; and then, his communion made, he chanted the psalm for
      the day unconscious of any other voice than his own, which rang out with
      crystal purity, flying upward till it reached the very ear of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to his room he ascended the stairs step by step, as
      advised by St. Bonaventura and St. Thomas Aquinas. His gait was slow, his
      mien grave; he kept his head bowed as he walked along, finding ineffable
      delight in complying with the most trifling regulations. Next came
      breakfast. It was pleasant in the refectory to see the hunks of bread and
      the glasses of white wine, set out in rows. He had a good appetite, and
      was of a joyous mood. He would say, for instance, that the wine was truly
      Christian&mdash;a daring allusion to the water which the bursar was taxed
      with putting in the bottles. Still his gravity at once returned to him on
      going in to lectures. He took notes on his knees, while the professor,
      resting his hands on the edge of his desk, talked away in familiar Latin,
      interspersed with an occasional word in French, when he was at fault for a
      better. A discussion would then follow in which the students argued in a
      strange jargon, with never a smile upon their faces. Then, at ten o&rsquo;clock,
      there came twenty minutes&rsquo; reading of Holy Writ. He fetched the Sacred
      Book, a volume richly bound and gilt-edged. Having kissed it with especial
      reverence, he read it out bare-headed, bowing every time he came upon the
      name of Jesus, Mary, or Joseph. And with the arrival of the second
      meditation he was ready to endure for love of God another and even longer
      spell of kneeling than the first. He avoided resting on his heels for a
      second even. He delighted in that examination of conscience which lasted
      for three-quarters of an hour. He racked his memory for sins, and at times
      even fancied himself damned for forgetting to kiss the pictures on his
      scapular the night before, or for having gone to sleep upon his left side&mdash;abominable
      faults which he would have willingly redeemed by wearing out his knees
      till night; and yet happy faults, in that they kept him busy, for without
      them he would have no occupation for his unspotted heart, steeped in a
      life of purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would return to the refectory, as if relieved of some great crime. The
      seminarists on duty, wearing blue linen aprons, and having their cassock
      sleeves tucked up, brought in the vermicelli soup, the boiled beef cut
      into little squares, and the helps of roast mutton and French beans. Then
      followed a terrific rattling of jaws, a gluttonous silence, a desperate
      plying of forks, only broken by envious greedy glances at the horseshoe
      table, where the heads of the seminary ate more delicate meats and drank
      ruddier wines. And all the while above the hubbub some strong-lunged
      peasant&rsquo;s son, with a thick voice and utter disregard for punctuation,
      would hem and haw over the perusal of some letters from missionaries, some
      episcopal pastoral, or some article from a religious paper. To this he
      listened as he ate. Those polemical fragments, those narratives of distant
      travels, surprised, nay, even frightened him, with their revelations of
      bustling, boundless fields of action, of which he had never dreamt, beyond
      the seminary walls. Eating was still in progress when the wooden clapper
      announced the recreation hour. The recreation-ground was a sandy yard, in
      which stood eight plane-trees, which in summer cast cool shadows around.
      On the south side rose a wall, seventeen feet high, and bristling with
      broken glass, above which all that one saw of Plassans was the steeple of
      St. Mark, rising like a stony needle against the blue sky. To and fro he
      slowly paced the court with a row of fellow-students; and each time he
      faced the wall he eyed that spire which to him represented the whole town,
      the whole earth spread beneath the scudding clouds. Noisy groups waxed hot
      in disputation round the plane-trees; friends would pair off in the
      corners under the spying glance of some director concealed behind his
      window-blind. Tennis and skittle matches would be quickly organised to the
      great discomfort of quiet loto players who lounged on the ground before
      their cardboard squares, which some bowl or ball would suddenly smother
      with sand. But when the bell sounded the noise ceased, a flight of
      sparrows rose from the plane-trees, and the breathless students betook
      themselves to their lesson in plain-chant with folded arms and hanging
      heads. And thus Serge&rsquo;s day closed in peacefulness; he returned to his
      work; then, at four o&rsquo;clock, he partook of his afternoon snack, and
      renewed his everlasting walk in sight of St. Mark&rsquo;s spire. Supper was
      marked by the same rattling of jaws and the same droning perusal as the
      midday meal. And when it was over Serge repaired to the chapel to attend
      prayers, and finally betook himself to bed at a quarter past eight, after
      first sprinkling his pallet with holy water to ward off all evil dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many delightful days like these had he not spent in that ancient
      convent of old Plassans, where abode the aroma of centuries of piety! For
      five years had the days followed one another, flowing on with the
      unvarying murmur of limpid water. In this present hour he recalled a
      thousand little incidents which moved him. He remembered going with his
      mother to purchase his first outfit, his two cassocks, his two waist
      sashes, his half-dozen bands, his eight pairs of socks, his surplice, and
      his three-cornered hat. And how his heart had beaten that mild October
      evening when the seminary door had first closed behind him! He had gone
      thither at twenty, after his school years, seized with a yearning to
      believe and love. The very next day he had forgotten all, as if he had
      fallen into a long sleep in that big silent house. He once more saw the
      narrow cell in which he had lived through his two years as student of
      philosophy&mdash;a little hutch with only a bed, a table, and a chair,
      divided from the other cells by badly fitted partitions, in a vast hall
      containing about fifty similar little dens. And he again saw the cell he
      had dwelt in three years longer while in the theology class&mdash;a larger
      one, with an armchair, a dressing-table, and a bookcase&mdash;a happy room
      full of the dreams which his faith had evoked. Down those endless
      passages, up those stairs of stone, in all sorts of nooks, sudden
      inspirations, unexpected aid had come to him. From the lofty ceilings fell
      the voices of guardian angels. There was not a flagstone in the halls, not
      an ashlar of the walls, not a bough of the plane-trees, but it spoke to
      him of the delights of his contemplative life, his lispings of tenderness,
      his gradual initiation, the favours vouchsafed him in return for
      self-bestowal, all that happiness of divine first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      On such and such a day, on awaking, he had beheld a bright flood of light
      which had steeped him in joy. On such and such an evening as he closed the
      door of his cell he had felt warm hands clasping his neck so lovingly that
      he had lost consciousness, and had afterwards found himself on the floor
      weeping and choked by sobs. Again, at other times, especially in the
      little archway leading to the chapel, he had surrendered himself to supple
      arms which raised him from the ground. All heaven had then been concerned
      in him, had moved round him, and imparted to his slightest actions a
      peculiar sense, an astonishing perfume, which seemed to cling faintly to
      his clothes, to his very skin. And again, he remembered the Thursday
      walks. They started at two o&rsquo;clock for some verdant nook about three miles
      from Plassans. Often they sought a meadow on the banks of the Viorne,
      where the gnarled willows steeped their leaves in the stream. But he saw
      nothing&mdash;neither the big yellow flowers in the meadow, nor the
      swallows sipping as they flew by, with wings lightly touching the surface
      of the little river. Till six o&rsquo;clock, seated in groups beneath the
      willows, his comrades and himself recited the Office of the Virgin in
      common, or read in pairs the &lsquo;Little Hours,&rsquo; the book of prayers
      recommended to young seminarists, but not enjoined on them.
    </p>

      Abbe Mouret smiled as he stirred the burning embers of his vine-stock
      fire. In all that past he only found great purity and perfect obedience.
      He had been a lily whose sweet scent had charmed his masters. He could not
      recall a single bad action. He had never taken advantage of the absolute
      freedom of those walks, when the two prefects in charge would go off to
      have a chat with a parish priest in the neighbourhood, or to have a smoke
      behind a hedge, or to drink beer with a friend. Never had he hidden a
      novel under his mattress, nor a bottle of <i>anisette</i> in a cupboard.
      For a long time, even, he had had no suspicion of the sinfulness around
      him&mdash;of the wings of chicken and the cakes smuggled into the seminary
      in Lent, of the guilty letters brought in by servers, of the abominable
      conversations carried on in whispers in certain corners of the courtyard.
      He had wept hot tears when he first perceived that few among his fellows
      loved God for His own sake. There were peasants&rsquo; sons there who had taken
      orders simply through their terror of conscription, sluggards who dreamed
      of a career of idleness, and ambitious youths already agitated by a vision
      of the staff and the mitre. And when he found the world&rsquo;s wickedness
      reappearing at the altar&rsquo;s very foot, he had withdrawn still further into
      himself, giving himself still more to God, to console Him for being
      forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did recollect, however, that he had crossed his legs one day in class,
      and that, when the professor reproved him for it, his face had become
      fiery red, as if he had committed some abominable action. He was one of
      the best students, never arguing, but learning his texts by heart. He
      established the existence and eternity of God by proofs drawn from Holy
      Writ, the opinions of the fathers of the Church, the universal consensus
      of all mankind. This kind of reasoning filled him with an unshakeable
      certainty. During his first year of philosophy, he had worked at his logic
      so earnestly that his professor had checked him, remarking that the most
      learned were not the holiest. In his second year, therefore, he had
      carried out his study of metaphysics as a regulation task, constituting
      but a small fraction of his daily duties. He felt a growing contempt for
      science; he wished to remain ignorant, in order to preserve the humility
      of his faith. Later on, he only followed the course of Rohrbacher&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Ecclesiastical History&rsquo; from submission; he ventured as far as Gousset&rsquo;s
      arguments, and Bouvier&rsquo;s &lsquo;Theological Course,&rsquo; without daring to take up
      Bellarmin, Liguori, Suarez, or St. Thomas Aquinas. Holy Writ alone
      impassioned him. Therein he found all desirable knowledge, a tale of
      infinite love which should be sufficient instruction for all men of
      good-will. He simply adopted the dicta of his teachers, casting on them
      the care of inquiry, needing nought of such rubbish to know how to love,
      and accusing books of stealing away the time which should be devoted to
      prayer. He even succeeded in forgetting his years of college life. He no
      longer knew anything, but was simplicity itself, a child brought back to
      the lispings of his catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the manner in which he had ascended step by step to the
      priesthood. And here his recollections thronged more quickly on him,
      softer, still warm with heavenly joy. Each year he had drawn nearer to
      God. His vacations had been spent in holy fashion at an uncle&rsquo;s, in
      confessions every day and communions twice a week. He would lay fasts upon
      himself, hide rock-salt inside his trunk, and kneel on it with bared knees
      for hours together. At recreation time he remained in chapel, or went up
      to the room of one of the directors, who told him pious and extraordinary
      stories. Then, as the fast of the Holy Trinity drew nigh, he was rewarded
      beyond all measure, overwhelmed by the stirring emotion which pervades all
      seminaries on the eve of ordinations. This was the great festival of all,
      when the sky opened to allow the elect to rise another step nearer unto
      God. For a fortnight in advance he imposed a bread and water diet on
      himself. He closed his window blinds so that he might not see the daylight
      at all, and he prostrated himself in the gloom to implore Jesus to accept
      his sacrifice. During the last four days he suffered torturing pangs,
      terrible scruples, which would force him from his bed in the middle of the
      night to knock at the door of some strange priest giving the Retreat&mdash;some
      barefooted Carmelite, or often a converted Protestant respecting whom some
      wonderful story was current. To him he would make at great length a
      general confession of his whole life in a voice choking with sobs.
      Absolution alone quieted him, refreshed him, as if he had enjoyed a bath
      of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the great day he felt wholly white; and so vividly was
      he conscious of his whiteness that he seemed to himself to shed light
      around him. The seminary bell rang out in clear notes, while all the
      scents of June&mdash;the perfume of blossoming stocks, of mignonette and
      of heliotropes&mdash;came over the lofty courtyard wall. In the chapel
      relatives were waiting in their best attire, so deeply moved that the
      women sobbed behind their veils. Next came the procession&mdash;the
      deacons about to receive their priesthood in golden chasubles, the
      sub-deacons in dalmatics, those in minor orders and the tonsured with
      their surplices floating on their shoulders and their black birettas in
      their hands. The organ rolled diffusing the flutelike notes of a canticle
      of joy. At the altar, the bishop officiated, staff in hand, assisted by
      two canons. All the Chapter were there, the priests of all the parishes
      thronged thick amid a dazzling wealth of apparel, a flaring of gold
      beneath a broad ray of sunlight falling from a window in the nave. The
      epistle over, the ordination began.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very hour Abbe Mouret could remember the chill of the scissors
      when he was marked with the tonsure at the beginning of his first year of
      theology. It had made him shudder slightly. But the tonsure had then been
      very small, hardly larger than a penny. Later, with each fresh order
      conferred on him, it had grown and grown until it crowned him with a white
      spot as large as a big Host. The organ&rsquo;s hum grew softer, and the censers
      swung with a silvery tinkling of their slender chains, releasing a
      cloudlet of white smoke, which unrolled in lacelike folds. He could see
      himself, a tonsured youth in a surplice, led to the altar by the master of
      ceremonies; there he knelt and bowed his head down low, while the bishop
      with golden scissors snipped off three locks&mdash;one over his forehead,
      and the other two near his ears. Yet another twelvemonth, and he could
      again see himself in the chapel amid the incense, receiving the four minor
      orders. Led by an archdeacon, he went to the main doorway, closed the door
      with a bang, and opened it again, to show that to him was entrusted the
      care of churches; next he rang a small bell with his right hand, in token
      that it was his duty to call the faithful to the divine offices; then he
      returned to the altar, where fresh privileges were conferred upon him by
      the bishop&mdash;those of singing the lessons, of blessing the bread, of
      catechising children, of exorcising evil spirits, of serving the deacons,
      of lighting and extinguishing the candles of the altars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came back the memory of the ensuing ordination, more solemn and more
      dread, amid the same organ strains which sounded now like God&rsquo;s own
      thunder: this time he wore a sub-deacon&rsquo;s dalmatic upon his shoulders, he
      bound himself for ever by the vow of chastity, he trembled in every pore,
      despite his faith, at the terrible <i>Accedite</i> from the bishop, which
      put to flight two of his companions, blanching by his side. His new duties
      were to serve the priest at the altar, to prepare the cruets, sing the
      epistle, wipe the chalice, and carry the cross in processions. And, at
      last, he passed once more, and for the last time, into the chapel, in the
      radiance of a June sun: but this time he walked at the very head of the
      procession, with alb girdled about his waist, with stole crossed over his
      breast, and chasuble falling from his neck. All but fainting from emotion,
      he could perceive the pallid face of the bishop giving him the priesthood,
      the fulness of the ministry, by the threefold laying of his hands. And
      after taking the oath of ecclesiastical obedience, he felt himself
      uplifted from the stone flags, when the prelate in a full voice repeated
      the Latin words: &lsquo;<i>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.... Quorum remiseris peccata,
      remittuntur eis, et quorum retinueris, retenta sunt</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Receive
      the Holy Ghost.... Whose sins thou dost forgive they are forgiven; and
      whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      This evocation of the deep joys of his youth had given Abbe Mouret a touch
      of feverishness. He no longer felt the cold. He put down the tongs and
      walked towards the bedstead as if about to go to bed, but turned back and
      pressed his forehead to a window-pane, looking out into the night with
      sightless eyes. Could he be ill? Why did he feel such languor in all his
      limbs, why did his blood burn in every vein? On two occasions, while at
      the seminary, he had experienced similar attacks&mdash;a sort of physical
      discomfort which made him most unhappy; one day, indeed, he had gone to
      bed in raving delirium. Then he bethought himself of a young girl
      possessed by evil spirits, whom Brother Archangias asserted he had cured
      with a simple sign of the cross, one day when she fell down before him.
      This reminded him of the spiritual exorcisms which one of his teachers had
      formerly recommended to him: prayer, a general confession, frequent
      communion, the choosing of a wise confessor who should have great
      authority on his mind. And then, without any transition, with a suddenness
      which astonished himself, he saw in the depths of his memory the round
      face of one of his old friends, a peasant, who had been a choir boy at
      eight years old, and whose expenses at the seminary were defrayed by a
      lady who watched over him. He was always laughing, he rejoiced beforehand
      at the anticipated emoluments of his career; twelve hundred francs of
      stipend, a vicarage at the end of a garden, presents, invitations to
      dinners, little profits from weddings, and baptismal and burial fees. That
      young fellow must indeed be happy in his parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling of melancholy regret evoked by this recollection surprised
      Abbe Mouret extremely. Was he not happy, too? Until that day he had
      regretted nothing, wished for nothing, envied nothing. Even as he searched
      himself at that very moment he failed to find any cause for bitterness. He
      believed himself the same as in the early days of his deaconship, when the
      obligatory perusal of his breviary at certain stated hours had filled his
      days with continuous prayer. No doubts had tormented him; he had
      prostrated himself before the mysteries he could not understand; he had
      sacrificed his reason, which he despised, with the greatest ease. When he
      left the seminary, he had rejoiced at finding himself a stranger among his
      fellowmen, no longer walking like them, carrying his head differently,
      possessed of the gestures, words, and opinions of a being apart. He had
      felt emasculated, nearer to the angels, cleansed of sexuality. It had
      almost made him proud to belong no longer to his species, to have been
      brought up for God and carefully purged of all human grossness by a
      jealously watchful training. Again, it had seemed to him as if for years
      he had been dwelling in holy oil, prepared with all due rites, which had
      steeped his flesh in beatification. His limbs, his brain, had lost
      material substance to gain in soulfulness, impregnated with a subtle
      vapour which, at times, intoxicated him and dizzied him as if the earth
      had suddenly failed beneath his feet. He displayed the fears, the
      unwittingness, the open candour of a cloistered maiden. He sometimes
      remarked with a smile that he was prolonging his childhood, under the
      impression that he was still quite little, retaining the same sensations,
      the same ideas, the same opinions as in the past. At six years old, for
      instance, he had known as much of God as he knew at twenty-five; in prayer
      the inflexions of his voice were still the same, and he yet took a
      childish pleasure in folding his hands quite correctly. The world too
      seemed to him the same as he had seen in former days when his mother led
      him by the hand. He had been born a priest, and a priest he had grown up.
      Whenever he displayed before La Teuse some particularly gross ignorance of
      life, she would stare him in the face, astounded, and remark with a
      strange smile that &lsquo;he was Mademoiselle Desiree&rsquo;s brother all over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his existence he could only recall one shock of shame. It had
      happened during his last six months at the seminary, between his
      deaconship and priesthood. He had been ordered to read the work of Abbe
      Craisson, the superior of the great seminary at Valence: &lsquo;<i>De rebus
      Veneris ad usum confessariorum</i>.&rsquo; And he had risen from this book
      terrified and choking with sobs. That learned casuistry, dealing so fully
      with the abominations of mankind, descending to the most monstrous
      examples of vice, violated, as it were, all his virginity of body and
      mind. He felt himself for ever befouled. Yet every time he heard
      confessions he inevitably recurred to that catechism of shame. And though
      the obscurities of dogma, the duties of his ministry, and the death of all
      free will within him left him calm and happy at being nought but the child
      of God, he retained, in spite of himself, a carnal taint of the horrors he
      must needs stir up; he was conscious of an ineffaceable stain, deep down
      somewhere in his being, which might some day grow larger and cover him
      with mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was rising behind the Garrigue hills. Abbe Mouret, still more and
      more feverish, opened the window and leaned out upon his elbows, that he
      might feel upon his face the coolness of the night. He could no longer
      remember at what time exactly this illness had come upon him. He
      recollected, however, that in the morning, while saying mass, he had been
      quite calm and restful. It must have been later, perhaps during his long
      walk in the sun, or while he shivered under the trees of the Paradou, or
      while stifling in Desiree&rsquo;s poultry-yard. And then he lived through the
      day again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him stretched the vast plain, more direful still beneath the pallid
      light of the oblique moonbeams. The olive and almond trees showed like
      grey spots amid the chaos of rocks spreading to the sombre row of hills on
      the horizon. There were big splotches of gloom, bumpy ridges, blood-hued
      earthy pools in which red stars seemed to contemplate one another, patches
      of chalky light, suggestive of women&rsquo;s garments cast off and disclosing
      shadowy forms which slumbered in the hollow folds of ground. At night that
      glowing landscape weltered there strangely, passionately, slumbering with
      uncovered bosom, and outspread twisted limbs, whilst heaving mighty sighs,
      and exhaling the strong aroma of a sweating sleeper. It was as if some
      mighty Cybele had fallen there beneath the moon, intoxicated with the
      embraces of the sun. Far away, Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s eyes followed the path to Les
      Olivettes, a narrow pale ribbon stretching along like a wavy stay-lace. He
      could hear Brother Archangias whipping the truant schoolgirls, and
      spitting in the faces of their elder sisters. He could see Rosalie slyly
      laughing in her hands while old Bambousse hurled clods of earth after her
      and smote her on her hips. Then, too, he thought, he had still been well,
      his neck barely heated by the lovely morning sunshine. He had felt but a
      quivering behind him, that confused hum of life, which he had faintly
      heard since morning when the sun, in the midst of his mass, had entered
      the church by the shattered windows. Never, then, had the country
      disturbed him, as it did at this hour of night, with its giant bosom, its
      yielding shadows, its gleams of ambery skin, its lavish goddess-like
      nudity, scarce hidden by the silvery gauze of moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest lowered his eyes, and gazed upon the village of Les
      Artaud. It had sunk into the heavy slumber of weariness, the soundness of
      peasants&rsquo; sleep. Not a light: the battered hovels showed like dusky mounds
      intersected by the white stripes of cross lanes which the moonbeams swept.
      Even the dogs were surely snoring on the thresholds of the closed doors.
      Had the Artauds poisoned the air of the parsonage with some abominable
      plague? Behind him gathered and swept the gust whose approach filled him
      with so much anguish. Now he could detect a sound like the tramping of a
      flock, a whiff of dusty air, which reached him laden with the emanations
      of beasts. Again came back his thoughts of a handful of men beginning the
      centuries over again, springing up between those naked rocks like thistles
      sown by the winds. In his childhood nothing had amazed and frightened him
      more than those myriads of insects which gushed forth when he raised
      certain damp stones. The Artauds disturbed him even in their slumber; he
      could recognise their breath in the air he inhaled. He would have liked to
      have had the rocks alone below his window. The hamlet was not dead enough;
      the thatched roofs bulged like bosoms; through the gaping cracks in the
      doors came low faint sounds which spoke of all the swarming life within.
      Nausea came upon him. Yet he had often faced it all without feeling any
      other need than that of refreshing himself in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brow perspiring, he proceeded to open the other window, as if to seek
      cooler air. Below him, to his left, lay the graveyard with the Solitaire
      erect like a bar, unstirred by the faintest breeze. From the empty field
      arose an odour like that of a newly mown meadow. The grey wall of the
      church, that wall full of lizards and planted with wall-flowers, gleamed
      coldly in the moonlight, and the panes of one of the windows glistened
      like plates of steel. The sleeping church could now have no other life
      within it than the extra-human life of the Divinity embodied in the Host
      enclosed in the tabernacle. He thought of the bracket lamp&rsquo;s yellow glow
      peeping out of the gloom, and was tempted to go down once more to try to
      ease his ailing head amid those deep shadows. But a strange feeling of
      terror held him back; he suddenly fancied, while his eyes were fixed upon
      the moonlit panes, that he saw the church illumined by a furnace-like
      glare, the blaze of a festival of hell, in which whirled the Month of May,
      the plants, the animals, and the girls of Les Artaud, who wildly encircled
      trees with their bare arms. Then, as he leaned over, he saw beneath him
      Desiree&rsquo;s poultry-yard, black and steaming. He could not clearly
      distinguish the rabbit-hutches, the fowls&rsquo; roosting-places, or the ducks&rsquo; 
      house. The place was all one big mass heaped up in stench, still exhaling
      in its sleep a pestiferous odour. From under the stable-door came the
      acrid smell of the nanny-goat; while the little pig, stretched upon his
      back, snorted near an empty porringer. And suddenly with his brazen throat
      Alexander, the big yellow cock, raised a crow, which awoke in the distance
      impassioned calls from all the cocks of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once Abbe Mouret remembered: The fever had struck him in
      Desiree&rsquo;s farmyard, while he was looking at the hens still warm from
      laying, the rabbit-does plucking the down from under them. And now the
      feeling that some one was breathing on his neck became so distinct that he
      turned at last to see who was behind him. And then he recalled Albine
      bounding out of the Paradou, and the door slamming upon the vision of an
      enchanted garden; he recalled the girl racing alongside the interminable
      wall, following the gig at a run, and throwing birch leaves to the breeze
      as kisses; he recalled her, again, in the twilight, laughing at the oaths
      of Brother Archangias, her skirts skimming over the path like a cloudlet
      of dust bowled along by the evening breeze. She was sixteen; how strange
      she looked, with her rather elongated face! she savoured of the open air,
      of the grass, of mother earth. And so accurate was his recollection of her
      that he could once more see a scratch upon one of her supple wrists, a
      rosy scar on her white skin. Why did she laugh like that when she looked
      at him with her blue eyes? He was engulfed in her laugh as in a sonorous
      wave which resounded and pressed close to him on every side; he inhaled
      it, he felt it vibrate within him. Yes, all his evil came from that laugh
      of hers which he had quaffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in the middle of the room, with both windows open, he remained
      shivering, seized with a fright which made him hide his face in his hands.
      So this was the ending of the whole day; this evocation of a fair girl,
      with a somewhat long face and eyes of blue. And the whole day came in
      through the open windows. In the distance&mdash;the glow of those red
      lands, the ardent passion of the big rocks, of the olive-trees springing
      up amid the stones, of the vines twisting their arms by the roadside.
      Nearer&mdash;the steam of human sweat borne in upon the air from Les
      Artaud, the musty odour of the cemetery, the fragrance of incense from the
      church, tainted by the scent of greasy-haired wenches. And there was also
      the steaming muck-heap, the fumes of the poultry-yard, the oppressing
      ferment of animal germs. And all these vapours poured in at once, in one
      asphyxiating gust, so offensive, so violent, as to choke him. He tried to
      close his senses, to subdue and annihilate them. But Albine reappeared
      before him like a tall flower that had sprung and grown beautiful in that
      soil. She was the natural blossom of that corruption, delicate in the
      sunshine, her white shoulders expanding in youthfulness, her whole being
      so fraught with the gladness of life, that she leaped from her stem and
      darted upon his mouth, scenting him with her long ripple of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry burst from the priest. He had felt a burning touch upon his lips. A
      stream as of fire coursed through his veins. And then, in search of
      refuge, he threw himself on his knees before the statuette of the
      Immaculate Conception, exclaiming, with folded hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holy Virgin of Virgins, pray for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Immaculate Conception, set on the walnut chest of drawers, was smiling
      softly, with her slender lips, marked by a dash of carmine. Her form was
      small and wholly white. Her long white veil, falling from head to foot,
      had but an imperceptible thread of gold around its edge. Her gown, draped
      in long straight folds over a sexless figure, was fastened around her
      flexible neck. Not a single lock of her chestnut hair peeped forth. Her
      countenance was rosy, with clear eyes upturned to heaven: her hands were
      clasped&mdash;rosy, childlike hands, whose finger-tips appeared beneath
      the folds of her veil, above the azure scarf which seemed to girdle her
      waist with two streaming ends of the firmament. Of all her womanly charms
      not one was bared, except her feet, adorable feet which trod the mystical
      eglantine. And from those nude feet sprang golden roses, like the natural
      efflorescence of her twofold purity of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Virgin most faithful, pray for me,&rsquo; the priest despairingly pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Virgin had never distressed him. She was not a mother yet; she did
      not offer Jesus to him, her figure did not yet present the rounded
      outlines of maternity. She was not the Queen of Heaven descending, crowned
      with gold and clothed in gold like a princess of the earth, borne in
      triumph by a flight of cherubim. She had never assumed an awesome mien;
      had never spoken to him with the austere severity of an all-powerful
      mistress, the very sight of whom must bow all foreheads to the dust. He
      could dare to look on her and love her, without fear of being moved by the
      gentle wave of her chestnut hair; her bare feet alone excited his
      affection, those feet of love which blossomed like a garden of chastity in
      too miraculous a manner for him to seek to cover them with kisses. She
      scented his room with lily-like fragrance. She was indeed the silver lily
      planted in a golden vase, she was precious, eternal, impeccable purity.
      Within the white veil, so closely drawn round her, there could be nothing
      human&mdash;only a virgin flame, burning with ever even glow. At night
      when he went to bed, in the morning when he woke, he could see her there,
      still and ever wearing that same ecstatic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother most pure, Mother most chaste, Mother ever-virgin, pray for me!&rsquo; 
      he stammered in his fear, pressing close to the Virgin&rsquo;s feet, as if he
      could hear Albine&rsquo;s sonorous footfalls behind him. &lsquo;You are my refuge, the
      source of my joy, the seat of my wisdom, the tower of ivory in which I
      have shut up my purity. I place myself in your spotless hands, I beseech
      you to take me, to cover me with a corner of your veil, to hide me beneath
      your innocence, behind the hallowed rampart of your garment&mdash;so that
      no fleshly breath may reach me. I need you, I die without you, I shall
      feel for ever parted from you, if you do not bear me away in your helpful
      arms, far hence into the glowing whiteness wherein you dwell. O Mary,
      conceived without sin, annihilate me in the depths of the immaculate snow
      that falls from your every limb. You are the miracle of eternal chastity.
      Your race has sprung from a very beam of grace, like some wondrous tree
      unsown by any germ. Your son, Jesus, was born of the breath of God; you
      yourself were born without defilement of your mother&rsquo;s womb, and I would
      believe that this virginity goes back thus from age to age in endless
      unwittingness of flesh. Oh! to live, to grow up outside the pale of the
      senses! Oh! to perpetuate life solely by the contact of a celestial kiss!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This despairing appeal, this cry of purified longing, calmed the young
      priest&rsquo;s fears. The Virgin&mdash;wholly white, with eyes turned
      heavenward, appeared to smile more tenderly with her thin red lips. And in
      a softened voice he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to be a child once more. I should like to be always a
      child, walking in the shadow of your gown. When I was quite little, I
      clasped my hands when I uttered the name of Mary. My cradle was white, my
      body was white, my every thought was white. I could see you distinctly, I
      could hear you calling me, I went towards you in the light of a smile over
      scattered rose-petals. And nought else did I feel or think, I lived but
      just enough to be a flower at your feet. No one should grow up. You would
      have around you none but fair young heads, a crowd of children who would
      love you with pure hands, unsullied lips, tender limbs, stainless as if
      fresh from a bath of milk. To kiss a child&rsquo;s cheek is to kiss its soul. A
      child alone can say your name without befouling it. In later years our
      lips grow tainted and reek of our passions. Even I, who love you so much,
      and have given myself to you, I dare not at all times call on you, for I
      would not let you come in contact with the impurities of my manhood. I
      have prayed and chastised my flesh, I have slept in your keeping, and
      lived in chastity; and yet I weep to see that I am not yet dead enough to
      this world to be your betrothed. O Mary! adorable Virgin, why can I not be
      only five years old&mdash;why could I not remain the child who pressed his
      lips to your pictures? I would take you to my heart, I would lay you by my
      side, I would clasp and kiss you like a friend&mdash;like a girl of my own
      age. Your close hanging garments, your childish veil, your blue scarf&mdash;all
      that youthfulness which makes you like an elder sister would be mine. I
      would not try to kiss your locks, for hair is a naked thing which should
      not be seen; but I would kiss your bare feet, one after the other, for
      nights and nights together, until my lips should have shred the petals of
      those golden roses, those mystical roses of our veins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, waiting for the Virgin to look down upon him and touch his
      forehead with the edges of her veil. But she remained enwrapped in muslin
      to her neck and finger-nails and ankles, so slim, so etherealised, that
      she already seemed to be above earth, to be wholly heaven&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; he went on more wildly still, &lsquo;grant that I become a child
      again, O kindly Virgin! Virgin most powerful. Grant that I may be only
      five years old. Rid me of my senses, rid me of my manhood. Let a miracle
      sweep away all the man that has grown up within me. You reign in heaven,
      nothing is easier to you than to change me, to rid me of all my strength
      so that evermore I may be unable to raise my little finger without your
      leave. I wish never more to feel either nerve, or muscle, or the beating
      of my heart. I long to be simply a thing&mdash;a white stone at your feet,
      on which you will leave but a perfume; a stone that will not move from
      where you cast it, but will remain earless and eyeless, content to lie
      beneath your heel, unable to think of foulness! Oh! then what bliss for
      me! I shall reach without an effort and at a bound my dream of perfection.
      I shall at last proclaim myself your true priest. I shall become what all
      my studies, my prayers, my five years of initiation have been unable to
      make me. Yes, I reject life; I say that the death of mankind is better
      than abomination. Everything is stained; everywhere is love tainted. Earth
      is steeped in impurity, whose slightest drops yield growths of shame. But
      that I may be perfect, O Queen of angels, hearken to my prayer, and grant
      it! Make me one of those angels that have only two great wings behind
      their cheeks; I shall then no longer have a body, no longer have any
      limbs; I will fly to you if you call me. I shall be but a mouth to sing
      your praises, a pair of spotless wings to cradle you in your journeys
      through the heavens. O death! death! Virgin, most venerable, grant me the
      death of all! I will love you for the death of my body, the death of all
      that lives and multiplies. I will consummate with you the sole marriage
      that my heart desires. I will ascend, ever higher and higher, till I have
      reached the brasier in which you shine in splendour. There one beholds a
      mighty planet, an immense white rose, whose every petal glows like a moon,
      a silver throne whence you beam with such a blaze of innocence that heaven
      itself is all illumined by the gleam of your veil alone. All that is
      white, the early dawns, the snow on inaccessible peaks, the lilies barely
      opening, the water of hidden, unknown springs, the milky sap of the plants
      untouched by the sun, the smiles of maidens, the souls of children dead in
      their cradles&mdash;all rains upon your white feet. And I will rise to
      your mouth like a subtle flame; I will enter into you by your parted lips,
      and the bridal will be fulfilled, while the archangels are thrilled by our
      joyfulness. Oh, to be maiden, to love in maidenhood, to preserve amid the
      sweetest kisses one&rsquo;s maiden whiteness! To possess all love, stretched on
      the wings of swans, in a sky of purity, in the arms of a mistress of
      light, whose caresses are but raptures of the soul! Oh, there lies the
      perfection, the super-human dream, the yearning which shatters my very
      bones, the joy which bears me up to heaven! O Mary, Vessel of Election,
      rid me of all that is human in me, so that you may fearlessly surrender to
      me the treasure of your maidenhood!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Abbe Mouret, felled by fever, his teeth chattering, swooned away
      on the floor.

      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through calico curtains, carefully drawn across the two large windows, a
      pale white light like that of breaking day filtered into the room. It was
      a lofty and spacious room, fitted up with old Louis XV. furniture, the
      woodwork painted white, the upholstery showing a pattern of red flowers on
      a leafy ground. On the piers above the doors on either side of the alcove
      were faded paintings still displaying the rosy flesh of flying Cupids,
      whose games it was now impossible to follow. The wainscoting with oval
      panels, the folding doors, the rounded ceiling (once sky-blue and framed
      with scrolls, medallions, and bows of flesh-coloured ribbons), had all
      faded to the softest grey. Opposite the windows the large alcove opened
      beneath banks of clouds which plaster Cupids drew aside, leaning over, and
      peeping saucily towards the bed. And like the windows, the alcove was
      curtained with coarsely hemmed calico, whose simplicity seemed strange in
      this room where lingered a perfume of whilom luxury and voluptuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated near a pier table, on which a little kettle bubbled over a
      spirit-lamp, Albine intently watched the alcove curtains. She was gowned
      in white, her hair gathered up in an old lace kerchief, her hands drooping
      wearily, as she kept watch with the serious mien of youthful womanhood. A
      faint breathing, like that of a slumbering child, could be heard in the
      deep silence. But she grew restless after a few minutes, and could not
      restrain herself from stepping lightly towards the alcove and raising one
      of the curtains. On the edge of the big bed lay Serge, apparently asleep,
      with his head resting on his bent arm. During his illness his hair had
      lengthened, and his beard had grown. He looked very white, with sunken
      eyes and pallid lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved by the sight Albine was about to let the curtain fall again. But
      Serge faintly murmured, &lsquo;I am not asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay perfectly still with his head on his arm, without stirring even a
      finger, as if overwhelmed by delightful weariness. His eyes had slowly
      opened, and his breath blew lightly on one of his hands, raising the
      golden down on his fair skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard you,&rsquo; he murmured again. &lsquo;You were walking very gently.&lsquo;*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * From this point in the original Serge and Albine thee and thou
    one another; but although this <i>tutoiement</i> has some bearing on
    the development of the story, it was impossible to preserve it
    in an English translation.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      His voice enchanted her. She went up to his bed and crouched beside it to
      bring her face on a level with his own. &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; she asked, and then
      continued: &lsquo;Oh! you are well now. Do you know, I used to cry the whole way
      home when I came back from over yonder with bad news of you. They told me
      you were delirious, and that if your dreadful fever did spare your life,
      it would destroy your reason. Oh, didn&rsquo;t I kiss your uncle Pascal when he
      brought you here to recruit your health!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she tucked in his bed-clothes like a young mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those burnt-up rocks over yonder, you see, were no good to you. You need
      trees, and coolness, and quiet. The doctor hasn&rsquo;t even told a soul that he
      was hiding you away here. That&rsquo;s a secret between himself and those who
      love you. He thought you were lost. Nobody will ever disturb you, you may
      be sure of that! Uncle Jeanbernat is smoking his pipe by his lettuce bed.
      The others will get news of you on the sly. Even the doctor isn&rsquo;t coming
      back any more. I am to be your doctor now. You don&rsquo;t want any more physic,
      it seems. What you now want is to be loved; do you see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to hear her, his brain as yet was void. His eyes, although
      his head remained motionless, wandered inquiringly round the room, and it
      struck her that he was wondering where he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my room,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I have given it to you. Isn&rsquo;t it a pretty
      one? I took the finest pieces of furniture out of the lumber attic, and
      then I made those calico curtains to prevent the daylight from dazzling
      me. And you&rsquo;re not putting me out a bit. I shall sleep on the second
      floor. There are three or four empty rooms there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he looked anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re alone?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; why do you ask that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but muttered wearily: &lsquo;I have been dreaming, I am
      always dreaming. I hear bells ringing, and they tire me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And after a pause he went on: &lsquo;Go and shut the door, bolt it; I want you
      to be alone, quite alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came back, bringing a chair with her, and sat down by his pillow,
      he looked as gleeful as a child, and kept on saying: &lsquo;Nobody can come in
      now. I shall not hear those bells any more. When you are talking to me, it
      rests me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like something to drink?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign that he was not thirsty. He looked at Albine&rsquo;s hands as if
      so astonished, so delighted to see them, that with a smile she laid one on
      the edge of his pillow. Then he let his head glide down, and rested his
      cheek against that small, cool hand, saying, with a light laugh: &lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s
      as soft as silk. It is just as if it were sending a cool breeze through my
      hair. Don&rsquo;t take it away, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came another long spell of silence. They gazed on one another with
      loving kindliness&mdash;Albine calmly scanning herself in the
      convalescent&rsquo;s eyes, Serge apparently listening to some faint whisper from
      the small, cool hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hand is so nice,&rsquo; he said once more. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t fancy what good it
      does me. It seems to steal inside me, and take away all the pain in my
      limbs. It&rsquo;s as if I were being soothed all over, relieved, cured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gently rubbed his cheek against it, with growing animation, as if he
      were at last coming back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t give me anything nasty to drink, will you? You won&rsquo;t worry me
      with all sorts of physic? Your hand is quite enough for me. I have come
      here for you to put it there under my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Serge,&rsquo; said Albine softly, &lsquo;how you must have suffered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suffered! yes, yes; but it&rsquo;s a long time ago. I slept badly, I had such
      frightful dreams. If I could, I would tell you all about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes for a moment and strove hard to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can see nothing but darkness,&rsquo; he stammered. &lsquo;It is very odd, I have
      just come back from a long journey. I don&rsquo;t even know now where I started
      from. I had fever, I know, a fever that raced through my veins like a wild
      beast. That was it&mdash;now I remember. The whole time I had a nightmare,
      in which I seemed to be crawling along an endless underground passage; and
      every now and then I had an attack of intolerable pain, and then the
      passage would be suddenly walled up. A shower of stones fell from
      overhead, the side walls closed in, and there I stuck, panting, mad to get
      on; and then I bored into the obstacle and battered away with feet and
      fists, and skull, despairing of ever being able to get through the ever
      increasing mound of rubbish. At other times, I only had to touch it with
      my finger and it vanished: I could then walk freely along the widened
      gallery, weary only from the pangs of my attack.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine tried to lay a hand upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t tire me to talk. I can whisper to you here, you
      see. I feel as if I were thinking and you could hear me. The queerest
      point about that underground journey of mine was that I hadn&rsquo;t the
      faintest idea of turning back again; I got obstinate, although I had the
      thought before me that it would take me thousands of years to clear away a
      single heap of wreckage. It seemed a fated task, which I had to fulfil
      under pain of the greatest misfortunes. So, with my knees all bruised, and
      my forehead bumping against the hard rock, I set myself to work with all
      my might, so that I might get to the end as quickly as possible. The end?
      What was it?... Ah! I do not know, I do not know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and pondered dreamily. Then, with a careless pout, he
      again sank upon Albine&rsquo;s hand and said laughing: &lsquo;How silly of me! I am a
      child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl, to ascertain if he were wholly hers, questioned him and led
      him back to the confused recollections he had tried to summon up. He could
      remember nothing, however; he was truly in a happy state of childhood. He
      fancied that he had been born the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I am not strong enough yet,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;My furthest recollection is of
      a bed which burned me all over, my head rolled about on a pillow like a
      pan of live coals, and my feet wore away with perpetual rubbing against
      each other. I was very bad, I know. It seemed as if I were having my body
      changed, as if I were being taken all to pieces, and put together again
      like some broken machine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at this simile, and continued: &lsquo;I shall be all new again. My
      illness has given me a fine cleaning. But what was it you were asking me?
      No, nobody was there. I was suffering all by myself at the bottom of a
      black hole. Nobody, nobody. And beyond that, nothing&mdash;I can see
      nothing.... Let me be your child, will you? You shall teach me to walk. I
      can see nothing else but you now. I care for nothing but you.... I can&rsquo;t
      remember, I tell you. I came, you took me, and that is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And restfully, pettingly, he said once more: &lsquo;How warm your hand is now!
      it is as nice as the sun. Don&rsquo;t let us talk any more. It makes me hot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A quivering silence fell from the blue ceiling of the large room. The
      spirit lamp had just gone out, and from the kettle came a finer and finer
      thread of steam. Albine and Serge, their heads side by side upon the
      pillow, gazed at the large calico curtains drawn across the windows.
      Serge&rsquo;s eyes, especially, were attracted to them as to the very source of
      light, in which he sought to steep himself, as in diluted sunshine fitted
      to his weakness. He could tell that the sun lay behind that yellower gleam
      upon one corner of the curtain, and that sufficed to make him feel himself
      again. Meanwhile a far-off rustle of leaves came upon his listening ear,
      and against the right-hand window the clean-cut greenish shadow of a lofty
      bough brought him disturbing thoughts of the forest which he could feel to
      be near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like me to open the curtains?&rsquo; asked Albine, misunderstanding
      his steady gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he hastily replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day; you would see the sunlight and the trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, please don&rsquo;t.... I don&rsquo;t want to see anything outside. That bough
      there tires me with its waving and its rising, as if it was alive. Leave
      your hand here, I will go to sleep. All is white now. It&rsquo;s so nice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he calmly fell asleep, while Albine watched beside him and
      breathed upon his face to make his slumber cool.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fine weather broke up on the morrow, and it rained heavily. Serge&rsquo;s
      fever returned, and he spent a day of suffering, with his eyes
      despairingly fixed upon the curtains through which the light now fell dim
      and ashy grey as in a cellar. He could no longer see a trace of sunshine,
      and he looked in vain for the shadow that had scared him, the shadow of
      that lofty bough which had disappeared amid the mist and the pouring rain,
      and seemed to have carried away with it the whole forest. Towards evening
      he became slightly delirious and cried out to Albine that the sun was
      dead, that he could hear all the sky, all the country bewailing the death
      of the sun. She had to soothe him like a child, promising him the sun,
      telling him that it would come back again, that she would give it to him.
      But he also grieved for the plants. The seeds, he said, must be suffering
      underground, waiting for the return of light; they had nightmares, they
      also dreamed that they were crawling along an underground passage,
      hindered by mounds of ruins, struggling madly to reach the sunshine. And
      he began to weep and sob out in low tones that winter was a disease of the
      earth, and that he should die with the earth, unless the springtide healed
      them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days more the weather was truly frightful. The downpour burst
      over the trees with the awful clamour of an overflowing river. Gusts of
      wind rolled by and beat against the windows with the violence of enormous
      waves. Serge had insisted on Albine closing the shutters. By lamplight he
      was no longer troubled by the gloom of the pallid curtains, he no longer
      felt the greyness of the sky glide in through the smallest chinks, and
      flow up to him like a cloud of dust intent on burying him. However,
      increasing apathy crept upon him as he lay there with shrunken arms and
      pallid features; his weakness augmented as the earth grew more ailing. At
      times, when the clouds were inky black, when the bending trees cracked,
      and the grass lay limp beneath the downpour like the hair of a drowned
      woman, he all but ceased to breathe, and seemed to be passing away,
      shattered by the hurricane. But at the first gleam of light, at the
      tiniest speck of blue between two clouds, he breathed once more and drank
      in the soothing calm of the drying leaves, the whitening paths, the fields
      quaffing their last draught of water. Albine now also longed for the sun;
      twenty times a day would she go to the window on the landing to scan the
      sky, delighted at the smallest scrap of white that she espied, but
      perturbed when she perceived any dusky, copper-tinted, hail-laden masses,
      and ever dreading lest some sable cloud should kill her dear patient. She
      talked of sending for Doctor Pascal, but Serge would not have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow there will be sunlight on the curtains,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and then I
      shall be well again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when his condition was most alarming, Albine again gave him
      her hand to rest his cheek upon. But when she saw that it brought him no
      relief she wept to find herself powerless. Since he had fallen into the
      lethargy of winter she had felt too weak to drag him unaided from the
      nightmare in which he was struggling. She needed the assistance of spring.
      She herself was fading away, her arms grew cold, her breath scant; she no
      longer knew how to breathe life into him. For hours together she would
      roam about the spacious dismal room, and as she passed before the mirror
      and saw herself darkening in it, she thought she had become hideous.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, however, as she raised his pillows, not daring to try again
      the broken spell of her hands, she fancied that she once more caught the
      first day&rsquo;s smile on Serge&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the shutters,&rsquo; he said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought him still delirious, for only an hour previously she had seen
      but a gloomy sky on looking out from the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, go to sleep,&rsquo; she answered sadly; &lsquo;I have promised to wake you at
      the very first ray&mdash;&mdash; Sleep on, there&rsquo;s no sun out yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I can feel it, its light is there.... Open the shutters.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      And there, indeed, the sunlight was. When Albine had opened the shutters,
      behind the large curtains, the genial yellow glow once more warmed a patch
      of the white calico. But that which impelled Serge to sit up in bed was
      the sight of the shadowy bough, the branch that for him heralded the
      return of life. All the resuscitated earth, with its wealth of greenery,
      its waters, and its belts of hills, was in that greenish blur that
      quivered with the faintest breath of air. It no longer disturbed him; he
      greedily watched it rocking, and hungered for the fortified powers of the
      vivifying sap which to him it symbolised. Albine, happy once more,
      exclaimed, as she supported him in her arms: &lsquo;Ah! my dear Serge, the
      winter is over. Now we are saved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay down again, his eyes already brighter, and his voice clearer.
      &lsquo;To-morrow I shall be very strong,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You shall draw back the
      curtains. I want to see everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the morrow he was seized with childish fear. He would not hear of
      the windows being opened wide. &lsquo;By-and-by,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;later on.&rsquo; He
      was fearful, he dreaded the first beam of light that would flash upon his
      eyes. Evening came on, and still he had been unable to make up his mind to
      look upon the sun. He remained thus all day long, his face turned towards
      the curtains, watching on their transparent tissue the pallor of morn, the
      glow of noon, the violet tint of twilight, all the hues, all the emotions
      of the sky. There were pictured even the quiverings of the warm air at the
      light stroke of a bird&rsquo;s wing, even the delight of earth&rsquo;s odours
      throbbing in a sunbeam. Behind that veil, behind that softened phantasm of
      the mighty life without, he could hear the rise of spring. He even felt
      stifled at times when in spite of the curtains&rsquo; barrier the rush of the
      earth&rsquo;s new blood came upon him too strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning he was still asleep when Albine, to hasten his
      recovery, cried out to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge! here&rsquo;s the sun!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She swiftly drew back the curtains and threw the windows wide open. He
      raised himself and knelt upon his bed, oppressed, swooning, his hands
      tightly pressed against his breast to keep his heart from breaking. Before
      him stretched the broad sky, all blue, a boundless blue; and in it he
      washed away his sufferings, surrendering himself to it, and drinking from
      it sweetness and purity and youth. The bough whose shadow he had noted
      jutted across the window and alone set against the azure sea its vigorous
      growth of green; but even this was too much for his sickly fastidiousness;
      it seemed to him that the very swallows flying past besmeared the purity
      of the azure. He was being born anew. He raised little involuntary cries,
      as he felt himself flooded with light, assailed by waves of warm air,
      while a whirling, whelming torrent of life flowed within him. As last with
      outstretched hands he sank back upon his pillow in a swoon of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a happy, delicious day that was! The sun came in from the right, far
      away from the alcove. Throughout the morning Serge watched it creeping
      onward. He could see it coming towards him, yellow as gold, perching here
      and there on the old furniture, frolicking in corners, at times gliding
      along the ground like a strip of ribbon. It was a slow deliberate march,
      the approach of a fond mistress stretching her golden limbs, drawing nigh
      to the alcove with rhythmic motion, with voluptuous lingering, which
      roused intense desire. At length, towards two o&rsquo;clock, the sheet of
      sunlight left the last armchair, climbed along the coverlet, and spread
      over the bed like loosened locks of hair. To its glowing fondling Serge
      surrendered his wasted hands: with his eyes half-closed, he could feel
      fiery kisses thrilling each of his fingers; he lay in a bath of light, in
      the embrace of a glowing orb. And when Albine leaned over smiling, &lsquo;Let me
      be,&rsquo; he stammered, his eyes now shut; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t hold me so tightly. How do
      you manage to hold me like this in your arms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sun crept down the bed again and slowly retreated to the left; and
      as Serge watched it bend once more and settle on chair after chair, he
      bitterly regretted that he had not kept it to his breast. Albine still sat
      upon the side of the bed, and the pair of them, an arm round each other&rsquo;s
      neck, watched the slow paling of the sky. At times a mighty thrill seemed
      to make it blanch. Serge&rsquo;s languid eyes now wandered over it more freely
      and detected in it exquisite tints of which he had never dreamed. It was
      not all blue, but rosy blue, lilac blue, tawny blue, living flesh, vast
      and spotless nudity heaving like a woman&rsquo;s bosom in the breeze. At every
      glance into space he found a fresh surprise&mdash;unknown nooks, coy
      smiles, bewitching rounded outlines, gauzy veils which were cast over the
      mighty, glorious forms of goddesses in the depths of peeping paradises.
      And with his limbs lightened by suffering he winged his way amid that
      shimmering silk, that stainless down of azure. The sun sank lower and
      lower, the blue melted into purest gold, the sky&rsquo;s living flesh gleamed
      fairer still, and then was slowly steeped in all the hues of gloom. Not a
      cloud&mdash;nought but gradual disappearance, a disrobing which left
      behind it but a gleam of modesty on the horizon. And at last the broad sky
      slumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the dear baby!&rsquo; exclaimed Albine, as she looked at Serge, who had
      fallen asleep upon her neck at the same time as the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid him down in bed and shut the windows. Next morning, however, they
      were opened at break of day. Serge could no longer live without the
      sunlight. His strength was growing, he was becoming accustomed to the
      gusts of air which sent the alcove curtains flying. Even the azure, the
      everlasting azure, began to pall upon him. He grew weary of being white
      and swanlike, of ever swimming on heaven&rsquo;s limpid lake. He came to wish
      for a pack of black clouds, some crumbling of the skies, that would break
      upon the monotony of all that purity. And as his health returned, he
      hungered for keener sensations. He now spent hours in gazing at the
      verdant bough: he would have liked to see it grow, expand, and throw out
      its branches to his very bed. It no longer satisfied him, but only roused
      desires, speaking to him as it did of all the trees whose deep-sounding
      call he could hear although their crests were hidden from his sight. An
      endless whispering of leaves, a chattering as of running water, a
      fluttering as of wings, all blended in one mighty, long-drawn, quivering
      voice, resounded in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you are able to get up,&rsquo; said Albine, &lsquo;you shall sit at the window.
      You will see the lovely garden!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and murmured gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I can see it, I hear it; I know where the trees are, where the water
      runs, where the violets grow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he added: &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t see it clearly, I see it without any
      light. I must be very strong before I shall be able to get as far as the
      window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At times when Albine thought him asleep, she would vanish for hours. And
      on coming in again, she would find him burning with impatience, his eyes
      gleaming with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been?&rsquo; he would call to her, taking hold of her arms, and
      feeling her skirts, her bodice, and her cheeks. &lsquo;You smell of all sorts of
      nice things. Ah! you have been walking on the grass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this she would laugh and show him her shoes wet with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been in the garden! you have been in the garden!&rsquo; he then
      exclaimed delightedly. &lsquo;I knew it. When you came in you seemed like a
      large flower. You have brought the whole garden in your skirt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would keep her by him, inhaling her like a nosegay. Sometimes she came
      back with briars, leaves, or bits of wood entangled in her clothes. These
      he would remove and hide under his pillow like relics. One day she brought
      him a bunch of roses. At the sight of them he was so affected that he
      wept. He kissed them and went to sleep with them in his arms. But when
      they faded, he felt so keenly grieved that he forbade Albine to gather any
      more. He preferred her, said he, for she was as fresh and as balmy; and
      she never faded, her hands, her hair, her cheeks were always fragrant. At
      last he himself would send her into the garden, telling her not to come
      back before an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that way,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I shall get sunlight, fresh air, and roses till
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, when he saw her coming in out of breath, he would cross-examine
      her. Which path had she taken? Had she wandered among the trees, or had
      she gone round the meadow side? Had she seen any nests? Had she sat down
      behind a bush of sweetbriar, or under an oak, or in the shade of a clump
      of poplars? But when she answered him and tried to describe the garden to
      him, he would put his hand to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he said gently. &lsquo;It is wrong of me. I don&rsquo;t want to know. I
      would rather see it myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he would relapse into his favourite dream of all the greenery which
      he could feel only a step away. For several days he lived on that dream
      alone. At first, he said, he had perceived the garden much more
      distinctly. As he gained strength, the surging blood that warmed his veins
      seemed to blur his dreamy imaginings. His uncertainties multiplied. He
      could no longer tell whether the trees were on the right, whether the
      water flowed at the bottom of the garden, or whether some great rocks were
      not piled below his windows. He talked softly of all this to himself. On
      the slightest indication he would rear wondrous plans, which the song of a
      bird, the creaking of a bough, the scent of a flower, would suddenly make
      him modify, impelling him to plant a thicket of lilac in one spot, and in
      another to place flower-beds where formerly there had been a lawn. Every
      hour he designed some new garden, much to the amusement of Albine, who,
      whenever she surprised him at it, would exclaim with a burst of laughter:
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not it, I assure you. You can&rsquo;t have any idea of it. It&rsquo;s more
      beautiful than all the beautiful things you ever saw. So don&rsquo;t go racking
      your head about it. The garden&rsquo;s mine, and I will give it to you. Be easy,
      it won&rsquo;t run away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, who had already been so afraid of the light, felt considerable
      trepidation when he found himself strong enough to go and rest his elbows
      on the window-sill. Every evening he once more repeated, &lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo; He would turn away in his bed with a shudder when Albine came
      in, and would cry out that she smelt of hawthorn, that she had scratched
      her hands in burrowing a hole through a hedge to bring him all its odour.
      One morning, however, she suddenly took him up in her arms, and almost
      carrying him to the window, held him there and forced him to look out and
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a coward you are!&rsquo; she exclaimed with her fine ringing laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      And waving one hand all round the landscape, she repeated with an air of
      triumph, full of tender promise: &lsquo;The Paradou! The Paradou!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge looked out upon it, speechless.
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A sea of verdure, in front, to right, to left, everywhere. A sea rolling
      its surging billows of leaves as far as the horizon, unhindered by house,
      or screen of wall, or dusty road. A desert, virgin, hallowed sea,
      displaying its wild sweetness in the innocence of solitude. The sun alone
      came thither, weltering in the meadows in a sheet of gold, threading the
      paths with the frolicsome scamper of its beams, letting its fine-spun,
      flaming locks droop through the trees, sipping from the springs with amber
      lips that thrilled the water. Beneath that flaming dust the vast garden
      ran riot like some delighted beast let loose at the world&rsquo;s very end, far
      from everything and free from everything. So prodigal was the luxuriance
      of foliage, so overflowing the tide of herbage, that from end to end it
      all seemed hidden, flooded, submerged. Nought could be seen but slopes of
      green, stems springing up like fountains, billowy masses, woodland
      curtains closely drawn, mantles of creepers trailing over the ground, and
      flights of giant boughs swooping down upon every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst that tremendous luxuriance of vegetation even lengthy scrutiny
      could barely make out the bygone plan of the Paradou. In the foreground,
      in a sort of immense amphitheatre, must have lain the flower garden, whose
      fountains were now sunken and dry, its stone balustrades shattered, its
      flight of steps all warped, and its statues overthrown, patches of their
      whiteness gleaming amidst the dusky stretches of turf. Farther back,
      behind the blue line of a sheet of water, stretched a maze of fruit-trees;
      farther still rose towering woodland, its dusky, violet depths streaked
      with bands of light. It was a forest which had regained virginity, an
      endless stretch of tree-tops rising one above the other, tinged with
      yellowish green and pale green and vivid green, according to the variety
      of the species.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right, the forest scaled some hills, dotting them with little
      clumps of pine-trees, and dying away in straggling brushwood, while a huge
      barrier of barren rock, heaped together like the fallen wreckage of a
      mountain, shut out all view beyond. Flaming growths there cleaved the
      rugged soil, monstrous plants lay motionless in the heat, like drowsing
      reptiles; a silvery streak, a foamy splash that glistened in the distance
      like a cloud of pearls, revealed the presence of a waterfall, the source
      of those tranquil streams that lazily skirted the flower-garden. Lastly,
      on the left the river flowed through a vast stretch of meadowland, where
      it parted into four streamlets which winded fitfully beneath the rushes,
      between the willows, behind the taller trees. And far away into the
      distance grassy patches prolonged the lowland freshness, forming a
      landscape steeped in bluish haze, where a gleam of daylight slowly melted
      into the verdant blue of sunset. The Paradou&mdash;its flower-garden,
      forest, rocks, streams, and meadows&mdash;filled the whole breadth of sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Paradou!&rsquo; stammered Serge, stretching out his arms as if to clasp the
      entire garden to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tottered, and Albine had to seat him in an armchair. There he sat for
      two whole hours intently gazing, without opening his lips, his chin
      resting on his hands. At times his eyelids fluttered and a flush rose to
      his cheeks. Slowly he looked, profoundly amazed. It was all too vast, too
      complex, too overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot see, I cannot understand,&rsquo; he cried, stretching out his hands to
      Albine with a gesture of uttermost weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl came and leant over the back of his armchair. Taking his head
      between her hands, she compelled him to look again, and softly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all our own. Nobody will ever come in. When you are well again, we
      will go for walks there. We shall have room enough for walking all our
      lives. We&rsquo;ll go wherever you like. Where would you like to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! not far,&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;The first day only two steps or so beyond the
      door. I should surely fall&mdash;&mdash; See, I&rsquo;ll go over there, under
      that tree close to the window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she resumed: &lsquo;Would you like to go into the flower-garden, the
      parterre? You shall see the roses&mdash;they have over-run everything,
      even the old paths are all covered with them. Or would you like the
      orchard better? I can only crawl into it on my hands and knees, the boughs
      are so bowed down with fruit. But we&rsquo;ll go even farther if you feel strong
      enough. We&rsquo;ll go as far as the forest, right into the depths of shade,
      far, far away; so far that we&rsquo;ll sleep out there when night steals over
      us. Or else, some morning, we can climb up yonder to the summit of those
      rocks. You&rsquo;ll see the plants which make me quake; you&rsquo;ll see the springs,
      such a shower of water! What fun it will be to feel the spray all over our
      faces!... But if you prefer to walk along the hedges, beside a brook, we
      must go round by the meadows. It is so nice under the willows in the
      evening, at sunset. One can lie down on the grass and watch the little
      green frogs hopping about on the rushes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Serge, &lsquo;you weary me, I don&rsquo;t want to go so far.... I will
      only go a couple of steps, that will be more than enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even I,&rsquo; she still continued, &lsquo;even I have not yet been able to go
      everywhere. There are many nooks I don&rsquo;t know. I have walked and walked in
      it for years, and still I feel sure there are unknown spots around, places
      where the shade must be cooler and the turf softer. Listen, I have always
      fancied there must be one especially in which I should like to live for
      ever. I know it&rsquo;s somewhere; I must have passed it by, or perhaps it&rsquo;s
      hidden so far away that I have never even got as far, with all my rambles.
      But we&rsquo;ll look for it together, Serge, won&rsquo;t we? and live there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, be quiet,&rsquo; stammered the young man. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you
      are saying. You&rsquo;re killing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she let him sob in her arms. It troubled and grieved her that
      she could find no words to soothe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Paradou as beautiful, then, as you fancied it?&rsquo; she asked at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his face and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It was quite little, and now it is ever growing bigger and
      bigger&mdash;&mdash; Take me away, hide me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him back to bed, soothing him like a child, lulling him with a
      fib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there! it&rsquo;s not true, there is no garden. It was only a story that
      I told you. Go, sleep in peace.&rsquo;

    <p>
      Every day in this wise she made him sit at the window during the cool
      hours of morning. He would now attempt to take a few steps, leaning the
      while on the furniture. A rosy tint appeared upon his cheeks, and his
      hands began to lose their waxy transparency. But, while he thus regained
      health, his senses remained in a state of stupor which reduced him to the
      vegetative life of some poor creature born only the day before. Indeed, he
      was nothing but a plant; his sole perception was that of the air which
      floated round him. He lacked the blood necessary for the efforts of life,
      and remained, as it were, clinging to the soil, imbibing all the sap he
      could. It was like a slow hatching in the warm egg of springtide. Albine,
      remembering certain remarks of Doctor Pascal, felt terrified at seeing him
      remain in this state, &lsquo;innocent,&rsquo; dull-witted like a little boy. She had
      heard it said that certain maladies left insanity behind them. And she
      spent hours in gazing at him and trying her utmost, as mothers do, to make
      him smile. But as yet he had not laughed. When she passed her hand across
      his eyes, he never saw, he never followed the shadow. Even when she spoke
      to him, he barely turned his head in the direction whence the sound came.
      She had but one consolation: he thrived splendidly, he was quite a
      handsome child.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another whole week she lavished the tenderest care on him. She
      patiently waited for him to grow. And as she marked various symptoms of
      awakening perception, her fears subsided and she began to think that time
      might make a man of him. When she touched him now he started slightly.
      Another time, one night, he broke into a feeble laugh. On the morrow, when
      she had seated him at the window, she went down into the garden, and ran
      about in it, calling to him the while. She vanished under the trees,
      flitted across the sunny patches, and came back breathless and clapping
      her hands. At first his wavering eyes failed to perceive her. But as she
      started off again, perpetually playing at hide-and-seek, reappearing
      behind every other bush, he was at last able to follow the white gleam of
      her skirt; and when she suddenly came forward and stood with upraised face
      below his window, he stretched out his arms and seemed anxious to go down
      to her. But she came upstairs again, and embraced him proudly: &lsquo;Ah! you
      saw me, you saw me!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;You would like to come into the garden
      with me, would you not?&mdash;&mdash; If you only knew how wretched you
      have made me these last few days, with your stupid ways, never seeing me
      or hearing me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her, but apparently with some slight sensation of pain that
      made him bend his neck in a shrinking way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are better now, however,&rsquo; she went on. &lsquo;Well enough to come down
      whenever you like&mdash;&mdash; Why don&rsquo;t you say anything? Have you lost
      your tongue? Oh, what a baby! Why, I shall have to teach him how to talk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon she really did amuse herself by telling him the names of the
      things he touched. He could only stammer, reiterating the syllables, and
      failing to utter a single word plainly. However, she began to walk him
      about the room, holding him up and leading him from the bed to the window&mdash;quite
      a long journey. Two or three times he almost fell on the way, at which she
      laughed. One day he fairly sat down on the floor, and she had all the
      trouble in the world to get him up on his feet again. Then she made him
      undertake the round of the room, letting him rest by the way on the sofa
      and the chairs&mdash;a tour round a little world which took up a good
      hour. At last he was able to venture on a few steps alone. She would stand
      before him with outstretched hands, and move backwards, calling him, so
      that he should cross the room in search of her supporting arms. If he
      sulked and refused to walk, she would take the comb from her hair and hold
      it out to him like a toy. Then he would come to her and sit still in a
      corner for hours, playing with her comb, and gently scratching his hands
      with its teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one morning she found him up. He had already succeeded in opening
      one of the shutters, and was attempting to walk about without leaning on
      the furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious, we are active this morning!&rsquo; she exclaimed gleefully.
      &lsquo;Why, he will be jumping out of the window to-morrow if he has his own way&mdash;&mdash;
      So you are quite strong now, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge&rsquo;s answer was a childish laugh. His limbs were regaining the strength
      of adolescence, but more perceptive sensations remained unroused. He spent
      whole afternoons in gazing out on the Paradou, pouting like a child that
      sees nought but whiteness and hears but the vibration of sounds. He still
      retained the ignorance of urchinhood&mdash;his sense of touch as yet so
      innocent that he failed to tell Albine&rsquo;s gown from the covers of the old
      armchairs. His eyes still stared wonderingly; his movements still
      displayed the wavering hesitation of limbs which scarce knew how to reach
      their goal; his state was one of incipient, purely instinctive existence
      into which entered no knowledge of surroundings. The man was not yet born
      within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, you&rsquo;ll act the silly, will you?&rsquo; muttered Albine. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
      see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her comb, and held it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have my comb?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Come and fetch it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had got him out of the room, by retreating before him all the
      way, she put her arm round his waist and helped him down each stair,
      amusing him while she put her comb back, even tickling his neck with a
      lock of her hair, so that he remained unaware that he was going
      downstairs. But when he was in the hall, he became frightened at the
      darkness of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just look!&rsquo; she cried, throwing the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a sudden dawn, a curtain of shadow snatched aside, revealing
      the joyousness of early day. The park spread out before them verdantly
      limpid, freshly cool and deep as a spring. Serge, entranced, lingered upon
      the threshold, with a hesitating desire to feel that luminous lake with
      his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One would think you were afraid of wetting yourself,&rsquo; said Albine. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      be frightened, the ground is safe enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ventured to take one step, and was astonished at encountering the
      soft resistance of the gravel. The first touch of the soil gave him a
      shock; life seemed to rebound within him and to set him for a moment
      erect, with expanding frame, while he drew long breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come now, be brave,&rsquo; insisted Albine. &lsquo;You know you promised me to take
      five steps. We&rsquo;ll go as far as the mulberry tree there under the window&mdash;&mdash;
      There you can rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It took him a quarter of an hour to make those five steps. After each
      effort he stopped as if he had been obliged to tear up roots that held him
      to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, pushing him along, said with a laugh: &lsquo;You look just like a
      walking tree.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having placed him with his back leaning against the mulberry tree, in the
      rain of sunlight falling from its boughs, she bounded off and left him,
      calling out to him that he must not stir. Serge, standing there with
      drooping hands, slowly turned his head towards the park. Terrestrial
      childhood met his gaze. The pale greenery was steeped in the very milk of
      youth, flooded with golden brightness. The trees were still in infancy,
      the flowers were as tender-fleshed as babes, the streams were blue with
      the artless blue of lovely infantile eyes. Beneath every leaf was some
      token of a delightful awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had fixed his eyes upon a yellow breach which a wide path made in
      front of him amidst a dense mass of foliage. At the very end, eastward,
      some meadows, steeped in gold, looked like the luminous field upon which
      the sun would descend, and he waited for the morn to take that path and
      flow towards him. He could feel it coming in a warm breeze, so faint at
      first that it barely brushed across his skin, but rising little by little,
      and growing ever brisker till he was thrilled all over. He could also
      taste it coming with a more and more pronounced savour, bringing the
      healthful acridity of the open air, holding to his lips a feast of sugary
      aromatics, sour fruits, and milky shoots. Further, he could smell it
      coming with the perfumes which it culled upon its way&mdash;the scent of
      earth, the scent of the shady woods, the scent of the warm plants, the
      scent of living animals, a whole posy of scents, powerful enough to bring
      on dizziness. He could likewise hear it coming with the rapid flight of a
      bird skimming over the grass, waking the whole garden from silence, giving
      voice to all it touched, and filling his ears with the music of things and
      beings. Finally, he could see it coming from the end of the path, from the
      meadows steeped in gold&mdash;yes, he could see that rosy air, so bright
      that it lighted the way it took with a gleaming smile, no bigger in the
      distance than a spot of daylight, but in a few swift bounds transformed
      into the very splendour of the sun. And the morn flowed up and beat
      against the mulberry tree against which Serge was leaning. And he himself
      resuscitated amidst the childhood of the morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge!&rsquo; cried Albine, lost to sight behind the high shrubs of the
      flower garden. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, I am here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge no longer felt frightened. He was being born anew in the
      sunshine, in that pure bath of light which streamed upon him. He was being
      born anew at five-and-twenty, his senses hurriedly unclosing, enraptured
      with the mighty sky, the joyful earth, the prodigy of loveliness spread
      out around him. This garden, which he knew not only the day before, now
      afforded him boundless delight. Everything filled him with ecstasy, even
      the blades of grass, the pebbles in the paths, the invisible puffs of air
      that flitted over his cheeks. His whole body entered into possession of
      this stretch of nature; he embraced it with his limbs, he drank it in with
      his lips, he inhaled it with his nostrils, he carried it in his ears and
      hid it in the depths of his eyes. It was his own. The roses of the flower
      garden, the lofty boughs of the forest, the resounding rocks of the
      waterfall, the meadows which the sun planted with blades of light, were
      his. Then he closed his eyes and slowly reopened them that he might enjoy
      the dazzle of a second wakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The birds have eaten all the strawberries,&rsquo; said Albine disconsolately,
      as she ran up to him. &lsquo;See, I have only been able to find these two!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she stopped short a few steps away, heart-struck and gazing at Serge
      with rapturous astonishment. &lsquo;How handsome you are!&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a little nearer; then stood there, absorbed in her contemplation,
      and murmuring: &lsquo;I had never, never seen you before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had certainly grown taller. Clothed in a loose garment, he stood erect,
      still somewhat slender, with finely moulded limbs, square chest, and
      rounded shoulders. His head, slightly thrown back, was poised upon a
      flexible and snowy neck, rimmed with brown behind. Health and strength and
      power were on his face. He did not smile, his expression was that of
      repose, with grave and tender mouth, firm cheeks, large nose, and grey,
      clear, commanding eyes. The long locks that thickly covered his head fell
      upon his shoulders in jetty curls; while a slender growth of hair, through
      which gleamed his white skin, curled upon his upper lip and chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! how handsome, how handsome you are!&rsquo; lingeringly repeated Albine,
      crouching at his feet and gazing up at him with loving eyes. &lsquo;But why are
      you sulking with me? Why don&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he stood there and made no answer. His eyes were far away; he never
      even saw that child at his feet. He spoke to himself in the sunlight, and
      said: &lsquo;How good the light is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That utterance sounded like a vibration of the sunlight itself. It fell
      amid the silence in the faintest of whispers like a musical sigh, a quiver
      of warmth and of life. For several days Albine had never heard his voice,
      and now, like himself, it had altered. It seemed to her to course through
      the park more sweetly than the melody of birds, more imperiously than the
      wind that bends the boughs. It reigned, it ruled. The whole garden heard
      it, though it had been but a faint and passing breath, and the whole
      garden was thrilled with the joyousness it brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak to me,&rsquo; implored Albine. &lsquo;You have never spoken to me like that.
      When you were upstairs in your room, when you were not dumb, you talked
      the silly prattle of a child. How is it I no longer know your voice? Just
      now I thought it had come down from the trees, that it reached me from
      every part of the garden, that it was one of those deep sighs that used to
      worry me at night before you came. Listen, everything is keeping silence
      to hear you speak again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But still he failed to recognise her presence. Tenderer grew her tones.
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t speak if it tires you. Sit down beside me, and we will remain
      here on the grass till the sun wanes. And look, I have found two
      strawberries. Such trouble I had too! The birds eat up everything. One&rsquo;s
      for you, both if you like; or we can halve them, and taste each of them.
      You&rsquo;ll thank me, and then I shall hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not sit down, he refused the strawberries, which Albine
      pettishly threw away. She did not open her lips again. She would rather
      have seen him ill, as in those earlier days when she had given him her
      hand for a pillow, and had felt him coming back to life beneath the
      cooling breath she blew upon his face. She cursed the returning health
      which now made him stand in the light like a young unheeding god. Would he
      be ever thus then, with never a glance for her? Would he never be further
      healed, and at last see her and love her? And she dreamed of once again
      being his healer, of accomplishing by the sole power of her little hands
      the cure of the second childhood in which he remained. She could clearly
      see that there was no spark in the depths of his grey eyes, that his was
      but a pallid beauty like that of the statues which had fallen among the
      nettles of the flower-garden. She rose and clasped him, breathing on his
      neck to rouse him. But that morning Serge never even felt the breath that
      lifted his silky beard. The sun got low, it was time to go indoors. On
      reaching his room, Albine burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that morning forward the invalid took a short walk in the garden
      every day. He went past the mulberry tree, as far as the edge of the
      terrace, where a wide flight of broken steps descended to the flowery
      parterre. He grew accustomed to the open air, each bath of sunlight
      brought him fresh vigour. A young chestnut tree, which had sprung from
      some fallen nut between two stones of the balustrade, burst the resin of
      its buds, and unfolded its leafy fans with far less vigour than he
      progressed. One day, indeed, he even attempted to descend the steps, but
      in this his strength failed him, and he sat down among the dane-wort which
      had grown up between the cracks in the stone flags. Below, to the left, he
      could see a small wood of roses. It was thither that he dreamt of going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little longer,&rsquo; said Albine. &lsquo;The scent of the roses is too strong
      for you yet. I have never been able to sit long under the rose-trees
      without feeling exhausted, light-headed, with a longing to cry. Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid, I will some day lead you to the rose-trees, and I shall surely
      weep among them, for you make me very sad.&rsquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning she at last succeeded in helping him to the foot of the steps,
      trampling down the grass before him with her feet, and clearing a way for
      him through the briars, whose supple arms barred the last few yards. Then
      they slowly entered the wood of roses. It was indeed a very wood, with
      thickets of tall standard roses throwing out leafy clumps as big as trees,
      and enormous rose bushes impenetrable as copses of young oaks. Here,
      formerly, there had been a most marvellous collection of plants. But since
      the flower garden had been left in abandonment, everything had run wild,
      and a virgin forest had arisen, a forest of roses over-running the paths,
      crowded with wild offshoots, so mingled, so blended, that roses of every
      scent and hue seemed to blossom on the same stem. Creeping roses formed
      mossy carpets on the ground, while climbing roses clung to others like
      greedy ivy plants, and ascended in spindles of verdure, letting a shower
      of their loosened petals fall at the lightest breeze. Natural paths
      coursed through the wood&mdash;narrow footways, broad avenues, enchanting
      covered walks in which one strolled in the shade and scent. These led to
      glades and clearings, under bowers of small red roses, and between walls
      hung with tiny yellow ones. Some sunny nooks gleamed like green silken
      stuff embroidered with bright patterns; other shadier corners offered the
      seclusion of alcoves and an aroma of love, the balmy warmth, as it were,
      of a posy languishing on a woman&rsquo;s bosom. The rose bushes had whispering
      voices too. And the rose bushes were full of songbirds&rsquo; nests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must take care not to lose ourselves,&rsquo; said Albine, as she entered the
      wood. &lsquo;I did lose myself once, and the sun had set before I was able to
      free myself from the rose bushes which caught me by the skirt at every
      step.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had barely walked a few minutes, however, before Serge, worn out with
      fatigue, wished to sit down. He stretched himself upon the ground, and
      fell into deep slumber. Albine sat musing by his side. They were on the
      edge of a glade, near a narrow path which stretched away through the wood,
      streaked with flashes of sunlight, and, through a small round blue gap at
      its far end, revealed the sky. Other little paths led from the clearing
      into leafy recesses. The glade was formed of tall rose bushes rising one
      above the other with such a wealth of branches, such a tangle of thorny
      shoots, that big patches of foliage were caught aloft, and hung there
      tent-like, stretching out from bush to bush. Through the tiny apertures in
      the patches of leaves, which were suggestive of fine lace, the light
      filtered like impalpable sunny dust. And from the vaulted roof hung stray
      branches, chandeliers, as it were, thick clusters suspended from green
      thread-like stems, armfuls of flowers that reached to the ground, athwart
      some rent in the leafy ceiling, which trailed around like a tattered
      curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine meanwhile was gazing at Serge asleep. She had never seen him so
      utterly prostrated in body as now, his hands lying open on the turf, his
      face deathly. So dead indeed he was to her that she thought she could kiss
      his face without his even feeling it. And sadly, absently, she busied her
      hands with shredding all the roses within her reach. Above her head
      drooped an enormous cluster which brushed against her hair, set roses on
      her twisted locks, her ears, her neck, and even threw a mantle of the
      fragrant flowers across her shoulders. Higher up, under her fingers, other
      roses rained down with large and tender petals exquisitely formed, which
      in hue suggested the faintly flushing purity of a maiden&rsquo;s bosom. Like a
      living snowfall these roses already hid her feet in the grass. And they
      climbed her knees, covered her skirt, and smothered her to her waist;
      while three stray petals, which had fluttered on to her bodice, just above
      her bosom, there looked like three glimpses of her bewitching skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the lazy fellow!&rsquo; she murmured, feeling bored and picking up two
      handfuls of roses, which she flung in Serge&rsquo;s face to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stir, however, but still lay there with the roses on his eyes
      and mouth. This made Albine laugh. She stooped down, and with her whole
      heart kissed both his eyes and his mouth, blowing as she kissed to drive
      the rose petals away; but they remained upon his lips, and she broke into
      still louder laughter, intensely amused at this flowery caressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge slowly raised himself. He gazed at her with amazement, as if
      startled at finding her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you? where do you come from? what are you doing here beside me?&rsquo; 
      he asked her. And still she smiled, transported with delight at marking
      this awakening of his senses. Then he seemed to remember something, and
      continued with a gesture of happy confidence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know, you are my love, flesh of my flesh, you are waiting for me that
      we may be one for ever. I was dreaming of you. You were in my breast, and
      I gave you my blood, my muscles, my bones. I felt no pain. You took half
      my heart so tenderly that I experienced keen inward delight at thus
      dividing myself. I sought all that was best and most beautiful within me
      to give it to you. You might have carried off everything, and still I
      should have thanked you. And I woke when you went out of me. You left
      through my eyes and mouth; ay, I felt it. You were all warm, all fragrant,
      so sweet that it was the thrill from you that has made me awake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine listened to his words with ecstasy. At last he saw her; at last his
      birth was accomplished, his cure begun. With outstretched hands she begged
      him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How have I managed to live without you?&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;No, I did not
      live, I was like a slumbering animal. And now you are mine! and you are no
      one but myself! Listen, you must never leave me; for you are my very
      breath, and in leaving me you would rob me of my life. We will remain
      within ourselves. You will be mine even as I shall be yours. Should I ever
      forsake you, may I be accursed, may my body wither like a useless and
      noxious weed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught hold of her hands, and exclaimed in a voice quivering with
      admiration: &lsquo;How beautiful you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the falling dust of sunshine Albine&rsquo;s skin looked milky white, scarce
      gilded here and there by the sunny sheen. The shower of roses around and
      on her steeped her in pinkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fair hair, loosely held together by her comb, decked her head as with
      a setting planet whose last bright sparks shone upon the nape of her neck.
      She wore a white gown; her arms, her throat, her stainless skin bloomed
      unabashed as a flower, musky with a goodly fragrance. Her figure was
      slender, not too tall, but supple as a snake&rsquo;s, with softly rounded,
      voluptuously expanding outlines, in which the freshness of childhood
      mingled with womanhood&rsquo;s nascent charms. Her oval face, with its narrow
      brow and rather full mouth, beamed with the tender living light of her
      blue eyes. And yet she was grave, too, her cheeks unruffled, her chin
      plump&mdash;as naturally lovely as are the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how I love you!&rsquo; said Serge, drawing her to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wholly one another&rsquo;s now, clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms! They did
      not kiss, but held each other round the waist, cheek to cheek, united,
      dumb, delighted with their oneness. Around them bloomed the roses with a
      mad, amorous blossoming, full of crimson and rosy and white laughter. The
      living, opening flowers seemed to bare their very bosoms. Yellow roses
      were there showing the golden skin of barbarian maidens: straw-coloured
      roses, lemon-coloured roses, sun-coloured roses&mdash;every shade of the
      necks which are ambered by glowing skies. Then there was skin of softer
      hue: among the tea roses, bewitchingly moist and cool, one caught glimpses
      of modest, bashful charms, with skin as fine as silk tinged faintly with a
      blue network of veins. Farther on all the smiling life of the rose
      expanded: there was the blush white rose, barely tinged with a dash of
      carmine, snowy as the foot of a maid dabbling in a spring; there was the
      silvery pink, more subdued than even the glow with which a youthful arm
      irradiates a wide sleeve; there was the clear, fresh rose, in which blood
      seemed to gleam under satin as in the bare shoulders of a woman bathed in
      light; and there was the bright pink rose with its buds like the nipples
      of virgin bosoms, and its opening flowers that suggested parted lips,
      exhaling warm and perfumed breath. And the climbing roses, the tall
      cluster roses with their showers of white flowers, clothed all these
      others with the lacework of their bunches, the innocence of their flimsy
      muslin; while, here and there, roses dark as the lees of wine,
      sanguineous, almost black, showed amidst the bridal purity like passion&rsquo;s
      wounds. Verily, it was like a bridal&mdash;the bridal of the fragrant
      wood, the virginity of May led to the fertility of July and August; the
      first unknowing kiss culled like a nosegay on the wedding morn. Even in
      the grass, moss roses, clad in close-fitting garments of green wool,
      seemed to be awaiting the advent of love. Flowers rambled all along the
      sun-streaked path, faces peeped out everywhere to court the passing
      breezes. Bright were the smiles under the spreading tent of the glade. Not
      a flower that bloomed the same: the roses differed in the fashion of their
      wooing. Some, shy and blushing, would show but a glimpse of bud, while
      others, panting and wide open, seemed consumed with infatuation for their
      persons. There were pert, gay little things that filed off, cockade in
      cap; there were huge ones, bursting with sensuous charms, like portly,
      fattened-up sultanas; there were impudent hussies, too, in coquettish
      disarray, on whose petals the white traces of the powder-puff could be
      espied; there were virtuous maids who had donned low-necked garb like
      demure <i>bourgeoises</i>; and aristocratic ladies, graceful and original,
      who contrived attractive deshabilles. And the cup-like roses offered their
      perfume as in precious crystal; the drooping, urn-shaped roses let it drip
      drop by drop; the round, cabbage-like roses exhaled it with the even
      breath of slumbering flowers; while the budding roses tightly locked their
      petals and only sent forth as yet the faint sigh of maidenhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you, I love you,&rsquo; softly repeated Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine, too, was a large rose, a pallid rose that had opened since the
      morning. Her feet were white, her arms were rosy pink, her neck was fair
      of skin, her throat bewitchingly veined, pale and exquisite. She was
      fragrant, she proffered lips which offered as in a coral cup a perfume
      that was yet faint and cool. Serge inhaled that perfume, and pressed her
      to his breast. Albine laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring of that laugh, which sounded like a bird&rsquo;s rhythmic notes,
      enraptured Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, that lovely song is yours?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is the sweetest I ever
      heard. You are indeed my joy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she laughed yet more sonorously, pouring forth rippling scales of
      high-pitched, flute-like notes that melted into deeper ones. It was an
      endless laugh, a long-drawn cooing, then a burst of triumphant music
      celebrating the delight of awakening love. And everything&mdash;the roses,
      the fragrant wood, the whole of the Paradou&mdash;laughed in that laugh of
      woman just born to beauty and to love. Till now the vast garden had lacked
      one charm&mdash;a winning voice which should prove the living mirth of the
      trees, the streams, and the sunlight. Now the vast garden was endowed with
      that charm of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old are you?&rsquo; asked Albine, when her song had ended in a faint
      expiring note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly twenty-six,&rsquo; Serge answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was amazed. What! he was twenty-six! He, too, was astonished at having
      made that answer so glibly, for it seemed to him that he had not yet lived
      a day&mdash;an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how old are you?&rsquo; he asked in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am sixteen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she broke into laughter again, quivering from head to foot, repeating
      and singing her age. She laughed at her sixteen years with a fine-drawn
      laugh that flowed on with rhythmic trilling like a streamlet. Serge
      scanned her closely, amazed at the laughing life that transfigured her
      face. He scarcely knew her now with those dimples in her cheeks, those
      bow-shaped lips between which peeped the rosy moistness of her mouth, and
      those eyes blue like bits of sky kindling with the rising of the sun. As
      she threw back her head, she sent a glow of warmth through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand, and fumbled mechanically behind her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; she asked. And suddenly remembering, she exclaimed:
      &lsquo;My comb! my comb! that&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her comb, and let fall her heavy tresses. A cloth of gold
      suddenly unrolled and clothed her to her hips. Some locks which flowed
      down upon her breast gave, as it were a finishing touch to her regal
      raiment. At the sight of that sudden blaze, Serge uttered an exclamation;
      he kissed each lock, and burned his lips amidst that sunset-like
      refulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine now relieved herself of her long silence, and chatted and
      questioned unceasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how wretched you made me! You no longer took any notice of me, and
      day after day I found myself useless and powerless, worried out of my wits
      like a good-for-nothing.... And yet the first few days I had done you
      good. You saw me and spoke to me.... Do you remember when you were lying
      down, and went to sleep on my shoulder, and murmured that I did you good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Serge, &lsquo;no, I don&rsquo;t remember it. I had never seen you before. I
      have only just seen you for the first time&mdash;lovely, radiant, never to
      be forgotten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She clapped her hands impatiently, exclaiming: &lsquo;And my comb? You must
      remember how I used to give you my comb to keep you quiet when you were a
      little child? Why, you were looking for it just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t remember. Your hair is like fine silk. I have never kissed
      your hair before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, with some vexation, she recounted certain particulars of his
      convalescence in the room with the blue ceiling. But he only laughed at
      her, and at last closed her lips with his hand, saying with anxious
      weariness: &lsquo;No, be quiet, I don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t want to know any more....
      I have only just woke up, and found you there, covered with roses. That is
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he drew her once more towards him and held her there, dreaming aloud,
      and murmuring: &lsquo;Perhaps I have lived before. It must have been a long,
      long time ago.... I loved you in a painful dream. You had the same blue
      eyes, the same rather long face, the same youthful mien. But your hair was
      carefully hidden under a linen cloth, and I never dared to remove that
      cloth, because your locks seemed to me fearsome and would have made me
      die. But to-day your hair is the very sweetness of yourself. It preserves
      your scent, and when I kiss it, when I bury my face in it like this, I
      drink in your very life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept on passing the long curls through his hands, and pressing them to
      his lips, as if to squeeze from them all Albine&rsquo;s blood. And after an
      interval of silence, he continued: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s strange, before one&rsquo;s birth, one
      dreams of being born.... I was buried somewhere. I was very cold. I could
      hear all the life of the world outside buzzing above me. But I shut my
      ears despairingly, for I was used to my gloomy den, and enjoyed some
      fearful delights in it, so that I never sought to free myself from all the
      earth weighing upon my chest. Where could I have been then? Who was it
      gave me light?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He struggled to remember, while Albine now waited in fear and trembling
      lest he should really do so. Smiling, she took a handful of her hair and
      wound it round the young man&rsquo;s neck, thus fastening him to herself. This
      playful act roused him from his musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am yours, what does the rest matter? It was
      you, was it not, who drew me out of the earth? I must have been under this
      garden. What I heard were your steps rattling the little pebbles in the
      path. You were looking for me, you brought down upon my head the songs of
      the birds, the scent of the pinks, the warmth of the sun. I fancied that
      you would find me at last. I waited a long time for you. But I never
      expected that you would give yourself to me without your veil, with your
      hair undone&mdash;the terrible hair which has become so soft.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat her on his lap, placing his face beside hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not let us talk any more. We are alone for ever. We love each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus in all innocence they lingered in each other&rsquo;s arms; for a long,
      long time did they remain there forgetfully. The sun rose higher; and the
      dust of light fell hotter from the lofty boughs. The yellow and white and
      crimson roses were now only a ray of their delight, a sign of their smiles
      to one another. They had certainly caused buds to open around them. The
      roses crowned their heads and threw garlands about their waists. And the
      scent of the roses became so penetrating, so strong with amorous emotion,
      that it seemed to be the scent of their own breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Serge put up Albine&rsquo;s hair. He raised it in handfuls with
      delightful awkwardness, and stuck her comb askew in the enormous knot that
      he had heaped upon her head. And as it happened she looked bewitching
      thus. Then, rising from the ground, he held out his hands to her, and
      supported her waist as she got up. They still smiled without speaking a
      word, and slowly they went down the path.
    </p>

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Albine and Serge entered the flower garden. She was watching him with
      tender anxiety, fearing lest he should overtire himself; but he reassured
      her with a light laugh. He felt strong enough indeed to carry her
      whithersoever she listed. When he found himself once more in the full
      sunlight, he drew a sigh of content. At last he lived; he was no longer a
      plant subject to the terrible sufferings of winter. And how he was moved
      with loving gratitude! Had it been within his power, he would have spared
      Albine&rsquo;s tiny feet even the roughness of the paths; he dreamed of carrying
      her, clinging round his neck, like a child lulled to sleep by her mother.
      He already watched over her with a guardian&rsquo;s watchful care, thrusting
      aside the stones and brambles, jealous lest the breeze should waft a
      fleeting kiss upon those darling locks which were his alone. She on her
      side nestled against his shoulder and serenely yielded to his guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Albine and Serge strolled on together in the sunlight for the first
      time. A balmy fragrance floated in their wake, the very path on which the
      sun had unrolled a golden carpet thrilled with delight under their feet.
      Between the tall flowering shrubs they passed like a vision of such
      wondrous charm that the distant paths seemed to entreat their presence and
      hail them with a murmur of admiration, even as crowds hail long-expected
      sovereigns. They formed one sole, supremely lovely being. Albine&rsquo;s snowy
      skin was but the whiteness of Serge&rsquo;s browner skin. And slowly they passed
      along clothed with sunlight&mdash;nay, they were themselves the sun&mdash;worshipped
      by the low bending flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tide of emotion now stirred the Paradou to its depths. The old flower
      garden escorted them&mdash;that vast field bearing a century&rsquo;s
      untrammelled growth, that nook of Paradise sown by the breeze with the
      choicest flowers. The blissful peace of the Paradou, slumbering in the
      broad sunlight, prevented the degeneration of species. It could boast of a
      temperature ever equable, and a soil which every plant had long enriched
      to thrive therein in the silence of its vigour. Its vegetation was mighty,
      magnificent, luxuriantly untended, full of erratic growths decked with
      monstrous blossoming, unknown to the spade and watering-pot of gardeners.
      Nature left to herself, free to grow as she listed, in the depths of that
      solitude protected by natural shelters, threw restraint aside more
      heartily at each return of spring, indulged in mighty gambols, delighted
      in offering herself at all seasons strange nosegays not meant for any hand
      to pluck. A rabid fury seemed to impel her to overthrow whatever the
      effort of man had created; she rebelliously cast a straggling multitude of
      flowers over the paths, attacked the rockeries with an ever-rising tide of
      moss, and knotted round the necks of marble statues the flexible cords of
      creepers with which she threw them down; she shattered the stonework of
      the fountains, steps, and terraces with shrubs which burst through them;
      she slowly, creepingly, spread over the smallest cultivated plots,
      moulding them to her fancy, and planting on them, as ensign of rebellion,
      some wayside spore, some lowly weed which she transformed into a gigantic
      growth of verdure. In days gone by the parterre, tended by a master
      passionately fond of flowers, had displayed in its trim beds and borders a
      wondrous wealth of choice blossoms. And the same plants could still be
      found; but perpetuated, grown into such numberless families, and
      scampering in such mad fashion throughout the whole garden, that the place
      was now all helter-skelter riot to its very walls, a very den of
      debauchery, where intoxicated nature had hiccups of verbena and pinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though to outward seeming Albine had yielded her weaker self to the
      guidance of Serge, to whose shoulder she clung, it was she who really led
      him. She took him first to the grotto. Deep within a clump of poplars and
      willows gaped a cavern, formed by rugged bits of rocks which had fallen
      over a basin where tiny rills of water trickled between the stones. The
      grotto was completely lost to sight beneath the onslaught of vegetation.
      Below, row upon row of hollyhocks seemed to bar all entrance with a
      trellis-work of red, yellow, mauve, and white-hued flowers, whose stems
      were hidden among colossal bronze-green nettles, which calmly exuded
      blistering poison. Above them was a mighty swarm of creepers which leaped
      aloft in a few bounds; jasmines starred with balmy flowers; wistarias with
      delicate lacelike leaves; dense ivy, dentated and resembling varnished
      metal; lithe honeysuckle, laden with pale coral sprays; amorous
      clematideae, reaching out arms all tufted with white aigrettes. And among
      them twined yet slenderer plants, binding them more and more closely
      together, weaving them into a fragrant woof. Nasturtium, bare and green of
      skin, showed open mouths of ruddy gold; scarlet runners, tough as
      whipcord, kindled here and there a fire of gleaming sparks; convolvuli
      opened their heart-shaped leaves, and with thousands of little bells rang
      a silent peal of exquisite colours; sweetpeas, like swarms of settling
      butterflies, folded tawny or rosy wings, ready to be borne yet farther
      away by the first breeze. It was all a wealth of leafy locks, sprinkled
      with a shower of flowers, straying away in wild dishevelment, and
      suggesting the head of some giantess thrown back in a spasm of passion,
      with a streaming of magnificent hair, which spread into a pool of perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never dared to venture into all that darkness,&rsquo; Albine whispered
      to Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He urged her on, carried her over the nettles; and as a great boulder
      barred the way into the grotto, he held her up for a moment in his arms so
      that she might be able to peer through the opening that yawned at a few
      feet from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A marble woman,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;has fallen full length into the stream.
      The water has eaten her face away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he, too, in his turn wanted to look, and pulled himself up. A cold
      breeze played upon his cheeks. In the pale light that glided through the
      hole, he saw the marble woman lying amidst the reeds and the duckweed. She
      was naked to the waist. She must have been drowning there for the last
      hundred years. Some grief had probably flung her into that spring where
      she was slowly committing suicide. The clear water which flowed over her
      had worn her face into a smooth expanse of marble, a mere white surface
      without a feature; but her breasts, raised out of the water by what
      appeared an effort of her neck, were still perfect and lifelike, throbbing
      even yet with the joys of some old delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She isn&rsquo;t dead yet,&rsquo; said Serge, getting down again. &lsquo;One day we will
      come and get her out of there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine shuddered and led him away. They passed out again into the
      sunlight and the rank luxuriance of beds and borders. They wandered
      through a field of flowers capriciously, at random. Their feet trod a
      carpet of lovely dwarf plants, which had once neatly fringed the walks,
      and now spread about in wild profusion. In succession they passed
      ankle-deep through the spotted silk of soft rose catchflies, through the
      tufted satin of feathered pinks, and the blue velvet of forget-me-nots,
      studded with melancholy little eyes. Further on they forced their way
      through giant mignonette, which rose to their knees like a bath of
      perfume; then they turned through a patch of lilies of the valley in order
      that they might spare an expanse of violets, so delicate-looking that they
      feared to hurt them. But soon they found themselves surrounded on all
      sides by violets, and so with wary, gentle steps they passed over their
      fresh fragrance inhaling the very breath of springtide. Beyond the
      violets, a mass of lobelias spread out like green wool gemmed with pale
      mauve. The softly shaded stars of globularia, the blue cups of nemophila,
      the yellow crosses of saponaria, the white and purple ones of sweet
      rocket, wove patches of rich tapestry, stretching onward and onward, a
      fabric of royal luxury, so that the young couple might enjoy the delights
      of that first walk together without fatigue. But the violets ever
      reappeared; real seas of violets that rolled all round them, shedding the
      sweetest perfumes beneath their feet and wafting in their wake the breath
      of their leaf-hidden flowerets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine and Serge quite lost themselves. Thousands of loftier plants
      towered up in hedges around them, enclosing narrow paths which they found
      it delightful to thread. These paths twisted and turned, wandered
      maze-like through dense thickets. There were ageratums with sky-blue tufts
      of bloom; woodruffs with soft musky perfume; brazen-throated mimuluses,
      blotched with bright vermilion; lofty phloxes, crimson and violet,
      throwing up distaffs of flowers for the breezes to spin; red flax with
      sprays as fine as hair; chrysanthemums like full golden moons, casting
      short faint rays, white and violet and rose, around them. The young couple
      surmounted all the obstacles that lay in their path and continued their
      way betwixt the walls of verdure. To the right of them sprang up the slim
      fraxinella, the centranthus draped with snowy blossoms, and the greyish
      hounds-tongue, in each of whose tiny flowercups gleamed a dewdrop. To
      their left was a long row of columbines of every variety; white ones, pale
      rose ones, and some of deep violet hues, almost black, that seemed to be
      in mourning, the blossoms that drooped from their lofty, branching stems
      being plaited and goffered like crape. Then, as they advanced further on,
      the character of the hedges changed. Giant larkspurs thrust up their
      flower-rods, between the dentated foliage of which gaped the mouths of
      tawny snapdragons, while the schizanthus reared its scanty leaves and
      fluttering blooms, that looked like butterflies&rsquo; wings of sulphur hue
      splashed with soft lake. The blue bells of campanulae swayed aloft, some
      of them even over the tall asphodels, whose golden stems served as their
      steeples. In one corner was a giant fennel that reminded one of a
      lace-dressed lady spreading out a sunshade of sea-green satin. Then the
      pair suddenly found their way blocked. It was impossible to advance any
      further; a mass of flowers, a huge sheaf of plants stopped all progress.
      Down below, a mass of brank-ursine formed as it were a pedestal, from the
      midst of which sprang scarlet geum, rhodanthe with stiff petals, and
      clarkia with great white carved crosses, that looked like the insignia of
      some barbarous order. Higher up still, bloomed the rosy viscaria, the
      yellow leptosiphon, the white colinsia, and the lagurus, whose dusty green
      bloom contrasted with the glowing colours around it. Towering over all
      these growths scarlet foxgloves and blue lupins, rising in slender
      columns, formed a sort of oriental rotunda gleaming vividly with crimson
      and azure; while at the very summit, like a surmounting dome of dusky
      copper, were the ruddy leaves of a colossal castor-bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Serge reached out his hands to try to force a passage, Albine stopped
      him and begged him not to injure the flowers. &lsquo;You will break the stems
      and crush the leaves,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Ever since I have been here, I have
      always taken care to hurt none of them. Come, and I will show you the
      pansies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made him turn and led him from the narrow paths to the centre of the
      parterre, where, once upon a time, great basins had been hollowed out. But
      these had now fallen into ruin, and were nothing but gigantic <i>jardinieres</i>,
      fringed with stained and cracked marble. In one of the largest of them,
      the wind had sown a wonderful basketful of pansies. The velvety blooms
      seemed almost like living faces, with bands of violet hair, yellow eyes,
      paler tinted mouths, and chins of a delicate flesh colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was younger they used to make me quite afraid,&rsquo; murmured Albine.
      &lsquo;Look at them. Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that they were thousands of little faces
      looking up at you from the ground? And they turn, too, all in the same
      direction. They might be a lot of buried dolls thrusting their heads out
      of the ground.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him still further on. They went the round of all the other basins.
      In the next one a number of amaranthuses had sprung up, raising monstrous
      crests which Albine had always shrunk from touching, such was their
      resemblance to big bleeding caterpillars. Balsams of all colours, now
      straw-coloured, now the hue of peach-blossom, now blush-white, now grey
      like flax, filled another basin where their seed pods split with little
      snaps. Then in the midst of a ruined fountain, there flourished a colony
      of splendid carnations. White ones hung over the moss-covered rims, and
      flaked ones thrust a bright medley of blossom between the chinks of the
      marble; while from the mouth of the lion, whence formerly the water-jets
      had spurted, a huge crimson clove now shot out so vigorously that the
      decrepit beast seemed to be spouting blood. Near by, the principal piece
      of ornamental water, a lake, on whose surface swans had glided, had now
      become a thicket of lilacs, beneath whose shade stocks and verbenas and
      day-lilies screened their delicate tints, and dozed away, all redolent of
      perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we haven&rsquo;t seen half the flowers yet,&rsquo; said Albine, proudly. &lsquo;Over
      yonder there are such huge ones that I can quite bury myself amongst them
      like a partridge in a corn-field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went thither. They tripped down some broad steps, from whose fallen
      urns still flickered the violet fires of the iris. All down the steps
      streamed gilliflowers, like liquid gold. The sides were flanked with
      thistles, that shot up like candelabra, of green bronze, twisted and
      curved into the semblance of birds&rsquo; heads, with all the fantastic elegance
      of Chinese incense-burners. Between the broken balustrades drooped tresses
      of stonecrop, light greenish locks, spotted as with mouldiness. Then at
      the foot of the steps another parterre spread out, dotted over with
      box-trees that were vigorous as oaks; box-trees which had once been
      carefully pruned and clipped into balls and pyramids and octagonal
      columns, but which were now revelling in unrestrained freedom of
      untidiness, breaking out into ragged masses of greenery, through which
      blue patches of sky were visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Albine led Serge straight on to a spot that seemed to be the graveyard
      of the flower-garden. There the scabious mourned, and processions of
      poppies stretched out in line, with deathly odour, unfolding heavy blooms
      of feverish brilliance. Sad anemones clustered in weary throngs, pallid as
      if infected by some epidemic. Thick-set daturas spread out purplish horns,
      from which insects, weary of life, sucked fatal poison. Marigolds buried
      with choking foliage their writhing starry flowers, that already reeked of
      putrefaction. And there were other melancholy flowers also: fleshy
      ranunculi with rusty tints, hyacinths and tuberoses that exhaled asphyxia
      and died from their own perfume. But the cinerarias were most conspicuous,
      crowding thickly in half-mourning robes of violet and white. In the middle
      of this gloomy spot a mutilated marble Cupid still remained standing,
      smiling beneath the lichens which overspread his youthful nakedness, while
      the arm with which he had once held his bow lay low amongst the nettles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Albine and Serge passed on through a rank growth of peonies, reaching
      to their waists. The white flowers fell to pieces as they passed, with a
      rain of snowy petals which was as refreshing to their hands as the heavy
      drops of a thunder shower. And the red ones grinned with apoplectical
      faces which perturbed them. Next they passed through a field of fuchsias,
      forming dense, vigorous shrubs that delighted them with their countless
      bells. Then they went on through fields of purple veronicas and others of
      geraniums, blazing with all the fiery tints of a brasier, which the wind
      seemed to be ever fanning into fresh heat. And they forced their way
      through a jungle of gladioli, tall as reeds, which threw up spikes of
      flowers that gleamed in the full daylight with all the brilliance of
      burning torches. They lost themselves too in a forest of sunflowers, with
      stalks as thick as Albine&rsquo;s wrist, a forest darkened by rough leaves large
      enough to form an infant&rsquo;s bed, and peopled with giant starry faces that
      shone like so many suns. And thence they passed into another forest, a
      forest of rhododendrons so teeming with blossom that the branches and
      leaves were completely hidden, and nothing but huge nosegays, masses of
      soft calyces, could be seen as far as the eye could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along; we have not got to the end yet,&rsquo; cried Albine. &lsquo;Let us push
      on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge stopped. They were now in the midst of an old ruined colonnade.
      Some of the columns offered inviting seats as they lay prostrate amongst
      primroses and periwinkles. Further away, among the columns that still
      remained upright, other flowers were growing in profusion. There were
      expanses of tulips showing brilliant streaks like painted china; expanses
      of calceolarias dotted with crimson and gold; expanses of zinnias like
      great daisies; expanses of petunias with petals like soft cambric through
      which rosy flesh tints gleamed; and other fields, with flowers they could
      not recognise spreading in carpets beneath the sun, in a motley brilliance
      that was softened by the green of their leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall never be able to see it all,&rsquo; said Serge, smiling and waving his
      hand. &lsquo;It would be very nice to sit down here, amongst all this perfume.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Near them there was a large patch of heliotropes, whose vanilla-like
      breath permeated the air with velvety softness. They sat down upon one of
      the fallen columns, in the midst of a cluster of magnificent lilies which
      had shot up there. They had been walking for more than an hour. They had
      wandered on through the flowers from the roses to the lilies. These
      offered them a calm, quiet haven after their lovers&rsquo; ramble amid the
      perfumed solicitations of luscious honeysuckle, musky violets, verbenas
      that breathed out the warm scent of kisses, and tuberoses that panted with
      voluptuous passion. The lilies, with their tall slim stems, shot up round
      them like a white pavilion and sheltered them with snowy cups, gleaming
      only with the gold of their slender pistils. And there they rested, like
      betrothed children in a tower of purity; an impregnable ivory tower, where
      all their love was yet perfect innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine and Serge lingered amongst the lilies till evening. They felt so
      happy there, and seemed to break out into a new life. Serge felt the last
      trace of fever leave his hands, while Albine grew quite white, with a
      milky whiteness untinted by any rosy hue. They were unconscious that their
      arms and necks and shoulders were bare, and their straying unconfined hair
      in nowise troubled them. They laughed merrily one at the other, with frank
      open laughter. The expression of their eyes retained the limpid calmness
      of clear spring water. When they quitted the lilies, their feelings were
      but those of children ten years old; it seemed to them that they had just
      met each other in that garden so that they might be friends for ever and
      amuse themselves with perpetual play. And as they returned through the
      parterre, the very flowers bore themselves discreetly, as though they were
      glad to see their childishness, and would do nothing that might corrupt
      them. The forests of peonies, the masses of carnations, the carpets of
      forget-me-nots, the curtains of clematis now steeped in the atmosphere of
      evening, slumbering in childlike purity akin to their own, no longer
      spread suggestions of voluptuousness around them. The pansies looked up at
      them with their little candid faces, like playfellows; and the languid
      mignonette, as Albine&rsquo;s white skirt brushed by it, seemed full of
      compassion, and held its breath lest it should fan their love prematurely
      into life.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At dawn the next day it was Serge who called Albine. She slept in a room
      on the upper floor. He looked up at her window and saw her throw open the
      shutters just as she had sprung out of bed. They laughed merrily as their
      eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not go out to-day,&rsquo; said Albine, when she came down. &lsquo;We must
      stay indoors and rest. To-morrow I will take you a long, long way off, to
      a spot where we can have a very jolly time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we grow tired of stopping here?&rsquo; muttered Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear no! I will tell you stories.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed a delightful day. The windows were thrown wide open, and all
      the beauty of the Paradou came in and rejoiced with them in the room.
      Serge now really took possession of that delightful room, where he
      imagined he had been born. He insisted upon seeing everything, and upon
      having everything explained to him. The plaster Cupids who sported round
      the alcove amused him so much that he mounted upon a chair to tie Albine&rsquo;s
      sash round the neck of the smallest of them, a little bit of a man who was
      turning somersaults with his head downward. Albine clapped her hands, and
      said that he looked like a cockchafer fastened by a string. Then, as
      though seized by an access of pity, she said, &lsquo;No, no, unfasten him. It
      prevents him from flying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the Cupids painted over the doors that more particularly
      attracted Serge&rsquo;s attention. He fidgeted at not being able to make out
      what they were playing at, for the paintings had grown very dim. Helped by
      Albine, he dragged a table to the wall, and when they both had climbed
      upon it, Albine began to explain things to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, now, those are throwing flowers. Under the flowers you can only see
      some bare legs. It seems to me that when first I came here I could make
      out a lady reposing there. But she has been gone for a long time now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They examined all the panels in turn; but they had faded to such a degree
      that little more could be distinguished than the knees and elbows of
      infants. The details which had doubtless delighted the eyes of those whose
      old-time passion seemed to linger round the alcove, had so completely
      disappeared under the influence of the fresh air, that the room, like the
      park, seemed restored to pristine virginity beneath the serene glory of
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! they are only some little boys playing,&rsquo; said Serge, as he descended
      from the table. &lsquo;Do you know how to play at &ldquo;hot cockles&rdquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no game that Albine did not know how to play at. But, for &lsquo;hot
      cockles,&rsquo; at least three players are necessary, and that made them laugh.
      Serge protested, however, that they got on too well together ever to
      desire a third there, and they vowed that they would always remain by
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are quite alone here; one cannot hear a sound,&rsquo; said the young man,
      lolling on the couch. &lsquo;And all the furniture has such a pleasant old-time
      smell. The place is as snug as a nest. We ought to be very happy in this
      room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had been at all timid,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;I should have been very much
      frightened at first.... That is one of the stories I want to tell you. The
      people in the neighbourhood told it to me. Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t true, but it
      will amuse us, at any rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she came and sat down by Serge&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is years and years since it all happened. The Paradou belonged to a
      rich lord, who came and shut himself up in it with a very beautiful lady.
      The gates of the mansion were kept so tightly closed, and the garden walls
      were built so very high, that no one ever caught sight even of the lady&rsquo;s
      skirts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I know,&rsquo; Serge interrupted; &lsquo;the lady was never seen again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Albine looked at him in surprise, somewhat annoyed to find that
      he knew her story already, he added in a low voice, apparently a little
      astonished himself: &lsquo;You told me the story before, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She declared that she had never done so; but all at once she seemed to
      change her mind, and allowed herself to be convinced. However, that did
      not prevent her from finishing her tale in these words: &lsquo;When the lord
      went away his hair was quite white. He had all the gates barricaded up, so
      that no one might get inside and disturb the lady. It was in this room
      that she died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this room!&rsquo; cried Serge. &lsquo;You never told me that! Are you quite sure
      that it was really in this room she died?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine seemed put out. She repeated to him what every one in the
      neighbourhood knew. The lord had built the pavilion for the reception of
      this unknown lady, who looked like a princess. The servants employed at
      the mansion afterwards declared that he spent all his days and nights
      there. Often, too, they saw him in one of the walks, guiding the tiny feet
      of the mysterious lady towards the densest coppices. But for all the world
      they would never have ventured to spy upon the pair, who sometimes scoured
      the park for weeks together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it was here she died?&rsquo; repeated Serge, who felt touched with sorrow.
      &lsquo;And you have taken her room; you use her furniture, and you sleep in her
      bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! well, you know, I am not timid. Besides, it is so long since it all
      happened. You said what a delightful room it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both dropped into silence, and glanced, for a moment, towards
      the alcove, the lofty ceiling, and the corners, steeped in grey gloom. The
      faded furniture seemed to speak of long past love. A gentle sigh, as of
      resignation, passed through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; murmured Serge, &lsquo;one could not feel afraid here. It is too
      peaceful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine came closer to him and said: &lsquo;There is something else that only
      a few people know, and that is that the lord and the lady discovered in
      the garden a certain spot where perfect happiness was to be found, and
      where they afterwards spent all their time. I have been told that by a
      very good authority. It is a cool, shady spot, hidden away in the midst of
      an impenetrable jungle, and it is so marvellously beautiful that anyone
      who reaches it forgets all else in the world. The poor lady must have been
      buried there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it anywhere about the parterre?&rsquo; asked Serge curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I cannot tell, I cannot tell,&rsquo; said the young girl with an expression
      of discouragement. &lsquo;I know nothing about it. I have searched everywhere,
      but I have never been able to find the least sign of that lovely clearing.
      It is not amongst the roses, nor the lilies, nor the violets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it is hidden somewhere away amongst those mournful-looking
      flowers, where you showed me the figure of a boy standing with his arm
      broken off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, then, it is in that grotto, near that clear stream, where the
      great marble woman, without a face, is lying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine seemed to reflect for a moment. Then, as though speaking to
      herself, she went on: &lsquo;As soon as ever I came here, I began to hunt for
      it. I spent whole days in the Paradou, and ferreted about in all the
      out-of-the-way green corners, to have the pleasure of sitting for an hour
      in that happy spot. What mornings have I not wasted in groping under the
      brambles and peeping into the most distant nooks of the park! Oh! I should
      have known it at once, that enchanting retreat, with the mighty tree that
      must shelter it with a canopy of foliage, with its carpet of soft silky
      turf, and its walls of tangled greenery, which the very birds themselves
      cannot penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her voice, and threw one of her arms round Serge&rsquo;s neck, as she
      continued: &lsquo;Tell me, now; shall we search for it together? We shall surely
      find it. You, who are strong, will push aside the heavy branches, while I
      crawl underneath and search the brakes. When I grow weary, you can carry
      me; you can help me to cross the streams; and if we happen to lose
      ourselves, you can climb the trees and try to discover our way again. Ah!
      and how delightful it will be for us to sit, side by side, beneath the
      green canopy in the centre of the clearing! I have been told that in one
      minute one may there live the whole of life. Tell me, my dear Serge, shall
      we set off to-morrow and scour the park, from bush to bush, until we have
      found what we want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge shrugged his shoulders, and smiled. &lsquo;What would be the use?&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;Is it not pleasant in the parterre? Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to
      remain among the flowers, instead of seeking a greater happiness that lies
      so far away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is there that the dead lady lies buried,&rsquo; murmured Albine, falling
      back into her reverie. &lsquo;It was the joy of being there that killed her. The
      tree casts a shade, whose charm is deathly.... I would willingly die so.
      We would clasp one another there, and we would die, and none would ever
      find us again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rsquo; interrupted Serge. &lsquo;You make me feel so unhappy. I
      would rather that we should live in the bright sunlight, far away from
      that fatal shade. Your words distress me, as though they urged us to some
      irreparable misfortune. It must be forbidden to sit beneath a tree whose
      shade can thus affect one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Albine gravely declared, &lsquo;it is forbidden. All the folks of the
      countryside have told me that it is forbidden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then silence fell. Serge rose from the couch where he had been lolling,
      and laughed, and pretended that he did not care about stories. The sun was
      setting, however, before Albine would consent to go into the garden for
      even a few minutes. She led Serge to the left, along the enclosing wall,
      to a spot strewn with fragments of stone, and woodwork, and ironwork,
      bristling too with briars and brambles. It was the site of the old
      mansion, still black with traces of the fire which had destroyed the
      building. Underneath the briars lay rotting timbers and fire-split
      masonry. The spot was like a little ravined, hillocky wilderness of
      sterile rocks, draped with rude vegetation, clinging creepers that twined
      and twisted through every crevice like green serpents. The young folks
      amused themselves by wandering across this chaos, groping about in the
      holes, turning over the debris, trying to reconstruct something of the
      past out of the ruins before them. They did not confess their curiosity as
      they chased one another through the midst of fallen floorings and
      overturned partitions; but they were indeed, all the time, secretly
      pondering over the legend of those ruins, and of that lady, lovelier than
      day, whose silken skirt had rustled down those steps, where now lizards
      alone were idly crawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge ended by climbing the highest of the ruinous masses; and, looking
      round at the park which unfolded its vast expanse of greenery, he sought
      the grey form of the pavilion through the trees. Albine was standing
      silent by his side, serious once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The pavilion is yonder, to the right,&rsquo; she said at last, without waiting
      for Serge to ask her. &lsquo;It is the only one of the buildings that is left.
      You can see it quite plainly at the end of that grove of lime-trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into silence again; and then Albine, as though pursuing aloud
      the reflections which were passing through their minds, exclaimed: &lsquo;When
      he went to see her, he must have gone down yonder path, then past those
      big chestnut trees, and then under the limes. It wouldn&rsquo;t take him a
      quarter of an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge made no reply. But as they went home, they took the path which
      Albine had pointed out, past the chestnuts and under the limes. It was a
      path that love had consecrated. And as they walked over the grass, they
      seemed to be seeking footmarks, or a fallen knot of ribbon, or a whiff of
      ancient perfume&mdash;something that would clearly satisfy them that they
      were really travelling along the path that led to the joy of union.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait out here,&rsquo; said Albine, when they once more stood before the
      pavilion; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t come up for three minutes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she ran off merrily, and shut herself up in the room with the blue
      ceiling. And when she had let Serge knock at the door twice, she softly
      set it ajar, and received him with an old-fashioned courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morrow, my dear lord,&rsquo; she said as she embraced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This amused them extremely. They played at being lovers with childish
      glee. In stammering accents they would have revived the passion which had
      once throbbed and died there. But it was like a first effort at learning a
      lesson. They knew not how to kiss each other&rsquo;s lips, but sought each
      other&rsquo;s cheeks, and ended by dancing around each other, with shrieks of
      laughter, from ignorance of any other way of showing the pleasure they
      experienced from their mutual love.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Albine was anxious to start at sunrise upon the grand
      expedition which she had planned the night before. She tapped her feet
      gleefully on the ground, and declared that they would not come back before
      nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going to take me?&rsquo; asked Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see, you will see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he caught her by the hands and looked her very earnestly in the face.
      &lsquo;You must not be foolish, you know. I won&rsquo;t have you hunting for that
      glade of yours, or for the tree, or for the grassy couch where one droops
      and dies. You know that it is forbidden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed slightly, protesting that she had no such idea in her head.
      Then she added: &lsquo;But if we should come across them, just by chance, you
      know, and without really seeking them, you wouldn&rsquo;t mind sitting down,
      would you? Else you must love me very little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off, going straight through the parterre without stopping to
      watch the awakening of the flowers which were all dripping after their
      dewy bath. The morning had a rosy hue, the smile of a beautiful child,
      just opening its eyes on its snowy pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you taking me?&rsquo; repeated Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine only laughed and would not answer. Then, on reaching the stream
      which ran through the garden at the end of the flower-beds, she halted in
      great distress. The water was swollen with the late rains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall never be able to get across,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;I can generally
      manage it by taking off my shoes and stockings, but, to-day, the water
      would reach to our waists.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked for a moment or two along the bank to find some fordable
      point; but the girl said it was hopeless; she knew the stream quite well.
      Once there had been a bridge across, but it had fallen in, and had strewn
      the river bed with great blocks of stone, between which the water rushed
      along in foaming eddies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get on to my back, then,&rsquo; said Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I&rsquo;d rather not. If you were to slip, we should both of us get a
      famous wetting. You don&rsquo;t know how treacherous those stones are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get on to my back,&rsquo; repeated Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tempted to do so. She stepped back for a spring, and then jumped
      up, like a boy; but she felt that Serge was tottering; and crying out that
      she was not safely seated, she got down again. However, after two more
      attempts, she managed to settle herself securely on Serge&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you are quite ready,&rsquo; said the young man, laughing, &lsquo;we will start.
      Now, hold on tightly. We are off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with three light strides, he crossed the stream, scarcely wetting
      even his toes. Midway, however, Albine thought that he was slipping. She
      broke out into a little scream, and hugged him tightly round his neck. But
      he sprang forward, and carried her at a gallop over the fine sand on the
      other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gee up!&rsquo; she cried, quite calm again, and delighted with this novel game.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran along with her for some distance, she clucking her tongue, and
      guiding him to right or left by some locks of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&mdash;here we are,&rsquo; she said at last, tapping him gently on the
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she jumped to the ground; while he, hot and perspiring, leaned
      against a tree to draw breath. Albine thereupon began to scold him, and
      threatened that she would not nurse him if he made himself ill again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s done me good. When I have grown quite strong
      again, I will carry you about all day. But where are you taking me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; she said, as she seated herself beneath a huge pear-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the old orchard of the park. A hawthorn hedge, a real wall of
      greenery with here and there a gap, separated it from everything else.
      There was quite a forest of fruit trees, which no pruning knife had
      touched for a century past. Some of the trees had been strangely warped
      and twisted by the storms which had raged over them; while others, bossed
      all over with huge knots and full of deep holes, seemed only to hold on to
      the soil with their bark. The high branches, bent each year by weight of
      fruit, stretched out like big rackets; and each tree helped to keep its
      fellows erect. The trunks were like twisted pillars supporting a roof of
      greenery; and sometimes narrow cloisters, sometimes light halls were
      formed, while now and again the verdure swept almost to the ground and
      left scarcely room to pass. Round each colossus a crowd of wild and
      self-sown saplings had grown up, thicket-like with the entanglement of
      their young shoots. In the greenish light which filtered like tinted water
      through the foliage, in the deep silence of the mossy soil, one only heard
      the dull thud of the fruit as it was culled by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were patriarchal apricot trees that bore their great age quite
      bravely. Though decayed on one side, where they showed a perfect
      scaffolding of dead wood, they were so youthful, so full of life, that, on
      the other, young shoots were ever bursting through their rough bark. There
      were cherry trees, that formed complete towns with houses of several
      stories, that threw out staircases and floors of branches, big enough for
      half a score of families. Then there were the apple trees, with their
      limbs twisted like old cripples, with bark gnarled and knotted, and all
      stained with lichen-growth. There were also smooth pear trees, that shot
      up mast-like with long slender spars. And there were rosy-blossomed
      peach-trees that won a place amid this teeming growth as pretty maids do
      amidst a human crowd by dint of bright smiles and gentle persistence. Some
      had been formerly trained as espaliers, but they had broken down the low
      walls which had once supported them, and now spread abroad in wild
      confusion, freed from the trammels of trellis work, broken fragments of
      which still adhered to some of their branches. They grew just as they
      listed, and resembled well-bred trees, once neat and prim, which, having
      gone astray, now flaunted but vestiges of whilom respectability. And from
      tree to tree, and from bough to bough, vine branches hung in confusion.
      They rose like wild laughter, twined for an instant round some lofty knot,
      then started off again with yet more sonorous mirth, splotching all the
      foliage with the merry ebriety of their tendrils. Their pale sun-gilt
      green set a glow of bacchanalianism about the weather-worn heads of the
      old orchard giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then towards the left were trees less thickly planted. Thin-foliaged
      almonds allowed the sun&rsquo;s rays to pass and ripen the pumpkins, which
      looked like moons that had fallen to the earth. Near the edge of a stream
      which flowed through the orchard there also grew various kinds of melons,
      some rough with knotty warts, some smooth and shining, as oval as the eggs
      of ostriches. At every step, too, progress was barred by currant bushes,
      showing limpid bunches of fruit, rubies in one and all of which there
      sparkled liquid sunlight. And hedges of raspberry canes shot up like wild
      brambles, while the ground was but a carpet of strawberry plants, teeming
      with ripe berries which exhaled a slight odour of vanilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the enchanted corner of the orchard was still further to the left,
      near a tier of rocks which there began to soar upwards. There you found
      yourself in a veritable land of fire, in a natural hot-house, on which the
      sun fell freely. At first, you had to make your way through huge, ungainly
      fig trees, which stretched out grey branches like arms weary of lying
      still, and whose villose leather-like foliage was so dense that in order
      to pass one constantly had to snap off twigs that had sprouted from the
      old wood. Next you passed on through groves of strawberry trees with
      verdure like that of giant box-plants, and with scarlet berries which
      suggested maize plants decked out with crimson ribbon. Then there came a
      jungle of nettle-trees, medlars and jujube trees, which pomegranates
      skirted with never-fading verdure. The fruit of the latter, big as a
      child&rsquo;s fist, was scarcely set as yet; and the purple blossoms, fluttering
      at the ends of the branches, looked like the palpitating wings of the
      humming birds, which do not even bend the shoots on which they perch.
      Lastly, there was a forest of orange and lemon trees growing vigorously in
      the open air. Their straight trunks stood like rows of brown columns,
      while their shiny leaves showed brightly against the blue of the sky, and
      cast upon the ground a network of light and shadow, figuring the palms of
      some Indian fabric. Here there was shade beside which that of the European
      orchard seemed colourless, insipid; the warm joy of sunlight, softened
      into flying gold-dust; the glad certainty of evergreen foliage; the
      penetrating perfume of blossom, and the more subdued fragrance of fruit;
      all helping to fill the body with the soft languor of tropical lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now let us breakfast,&rsquo; cried Albine, clapping her hands. &lsquo;It must be
      at least nine o&rsquo;clock, and I am very hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen from the ground. Serge confessed that he, too, would find
      some food acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You goose!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you didn&rsquo;t understand, then, that I brought you
      here to breakfast. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t die of hunger here. We can help ourselves to
      all there is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went along under the trees, pushing aside the branches and making
      their way to the thickest of the fruit. Albine, who went first, turned,
      and in her flute-like voice asked her companion: &lsquo;What do you like best?
      Pears, apricots, cherries, or currants? I warn you that the pears are
      still green; but they are very nice all the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge decided upon having cherries, and Albine agreed it would be as well
      to start with them; but when she saw him foolishly beginning to scramble
      up the first cherry tree he found, she made him go on for another ten
      minutes through a frightful entanglement of branches. The cherries on this
      tree, she said, were small and good for nothing; those on that were sour;
      those on another would not be ripe for at least a week. She knew all the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, climb this one,&rsquo; she said at last, as she stopped at the foot of a
      tree, so heavily laden with fruit that clusters of it hung down to the
      ground, like strings of coral beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge settled himself comfortably between two branches and began his
      breakfast. He no longer paid attention to Albine. He imagined she was in
      another tree, a few yards away, when, happening to cast his eyes towards
      the ground, he saw her calmly lying on her back beneath him. She had
      thrown herself there, and, without troubling herself to use her hands, was
      plucking with her teeth the cherries which dangled over her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw she was discovered, she broke out into a peal of laughter,
      and twisted about on the grass like a fish taken from the water. And
      finally, crawling along on her elbows, she gradually made the circuit of
      the tree, snapping up the plumpest cherries as she went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They tickle me so,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;See, there&rsquo;s a beauty just fallen on my
      neck. They are so deliciously fresh and juicy. They get into my ears, my
      eyes, my nose, everywhere. They are much sweeter down here than up there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Serge, laughing, &lsquo;you say that because you daren&rsquo;t climb up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained for a moment silent with indignation. &lsquo;Daren&rsquo;t!&mdash;I!&mdash;&rsquo; 
      she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having gathered up her skirts, she tightly grasped the tree and
      pulled herself up the trunk with a single effort of her strong wrists. And
      afterwards she stepped lightly along the branches, scarcely using her
      hands to steady herself. She had all the agile nimbleness of a squirrel,
      and made her way onward, maintaining her equilibrium only by the swaying
      poise of her body. When she was quite aloft at the end of a frail branch,
      which shook dangerously beneath her weight, she cried; &lsquo;Now you see
      whether I daren&rsquo;t climb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come down at once,&rsquo; implored Serge, full of alarm for her. &lsquo;I beg of you
      to come down. You will be injuring yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, enjoying her triumph, began to mount still higher. She crawled
      along to the extreme end of a branch, grasping its leaves in her hands to
      maintain her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The branch will break!&rsquo; cried Serge, thoroughly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it break,&rsquo; she answered, with a laugh; &lsquo;it will save me the trouble
      of getting down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the branch did break, but only slowly, with such deliberation that, as
      it gradually settled towards the ground, it let Albine slip down in very
      gentle fashion. She did not appear in the least degree frightened; but
      gave herself a shake, and said: &lsquo;That was really nice. It was quite like
      being in a carriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had jumped down from the tree to catch her in his arms. As he stood
      there, quite pale from fright, she laughed at him. &lsquo;One tumbles down from
      trees every day,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;but there is never any harm done. Look
      more cheerful, you great stupid! Stay, just wet your finger and rub it
      upon my neck. I have scratched it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge wetted his finger and touched her neck with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, I am all right again now,&rsquo; she cried, as she bounded off. &lsquo;Let us
      play at hide and seek, shall we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the first to hide. She disappeared, and presently from the depths
      of the greenery, which she alone knew, and where Serge could not possibly
      find her, she called, &lsquo;Cuckoo, cuckoo.&rsquo; But this game of hide and seek did
      not put a stop to the onslaught upon the fruit trees. Breakfasting went on
      in all the nooks and corners where the two big children sought each other.
      Albine, while gliding beneath the branches, would stretch out her hand to
      pluck a green pear or fill her skirt with apricots. Then in some of her
      lurking-places she would come upon such rich discoveries as would make her
      careless of the game, content to sit upon the ground and remain eating.
      Once, however, she lost sound of Serge&rsquo;s movements. So, in her turn, she
      set about seeking him; and she was surprised, almost vexed, when she
      discovered him under a plum-tree, of whose existence she herself had been
      ignorant, and whose ripe fruit had a delicious musky perfume. She soundly
      rated him. Did he want to eat everything himself, that he hadn&rsquo;t called to
      her to come? He pretended to know nothing about the trees, but he
      evidently had a very keen scent to be able to find all the good things.
      She was especially indignant with the poor tree itself&mdash;a stupid tree
      which no one had known of, and which must have sprung up in the night on
      purpose to put people out. As she stood there pouting, refusing to pluck a
      single plum, it occurred to Serge to shake the tree violently. And then a
      shower, a regular hail, of plums came down. Albine, standing in the midst
      of the downfall, received plums on her arms, plums on her neck, plums on
      the very tip of her nose. At this she could no longer restrain her
      laughter; she stood in the midst of the deluge, crying &lsquo;More! more!&rsquo; 
      amused as she was by the round bullet-like fruit which fell around her as
      she squatted there, with hands and mouth open, and eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a morning of childish play, of wild gambols in the Paradou. Albine
      and Serge spent hours, scampering up and down, shouting and sporting with
      each other, their thoughts still all innocence. And in what a delicious
      spot they found themselves! Depths of greenery, with undiscoverable
      hiding-places; paths, along whose windings it was never possible to be
      serious, such greedy laughter fell from the very hedges. In this happy
      orchard, there was such a playful straggling of bushes, such fresh and
      appetising shade, such a wealth of old trees laden like kindly
      grandfathers with sweet dainties. Even in the depths of the recesses green
      with moss, beneath the broken trunks which compelled them to creep the one
      behind the other, in the narrow leafy alleys, the young folks never
      succumbed to the perilous reveries of silence. No trouble touched them in
      that happy wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they had grown weary of the apricot-trees and the plum-trees and
      the cherry-trees, they ran beneath the slender almond-trees; eating green
      almonds, scarcely yet as big as peas, hunting for strawberries in the
      grassy carpet, and regretting that the melons were not already ripe.
      Albine finished by running as fast as she could go, pursued by Serge, who
      was unable to overtake her. She rushed amongst the fig-trees, leaping over
      their heavy branches, and pulling off the leaves to throw them behind her
      in her companion&rsquo;s face. In a few strides she had cleared the clumps of
      arbutus, whose red berries she tasted on her way; and it was in the jungle
      of nettle-trees, medlars, and jujube-trees that Serge lost her. At first
      he thought she was hiding behind a pomegranate; but found that he had
      mistaken two clustering blossoms for the rosy roundness of her wrists.
      Then he scoured the plantation of orange-trees, rejoicing in their beauty
      and perfume, and thinking that he must have reached the abode of the
      fairies of the sun. In the midst of them he caught sight of Albine, who,
      not believing him so near her, was peering inquisitively into the green
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you looking for?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You know very well that is
      forbidden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up hastily, and slightly blushed for the first time that day.
      Then sitting down by the side of Serge, she told him of the fine times
      there would be when the oranges should be ripe. The wood would then be all
      golden, all bright with those round stars, dotting with yellow sparks the
      arching green.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last they really set off homeward she halted at every wild-growing
      fruit tree, and filled her pockets with sour pears and bitter plums,
      saying that they world be good to eat on their way. They would prove a
      hundred times more enjoyable than anything they had tasted before. Serge
      was obliged to swallow some of them, in spite of the grimaces he made at
      each bite. And eventually they found themselves indoors again, tired out
      but feeling very happy.

    <h2>
      X
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later there was another expedition to the park. They had planned to
      extend their rambles beyond the orchard, striking out to the left through
      the meadows watered by the four streams. They would travel several miles
      over the thick grass, and they might live on fish, if they happened to
      lose themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will take my knife,&rsquo; said Albine, holding up a broad-bladed peasant&rsquo;s
      knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crammed all kinds of things into her pockets, string, bread, matches,
      a small bottle of wine, some rags, a comb, and some needles. Serge took a
      rug, but by the time they had passed the lime-trees and reached the ruins
      of the chateau, he found it such an encumbrance that he hid it beneath a
      piece of fallen wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was hotter than before, Albine had delayed their departure by her
      extensive preparations. Thus in the heat of the morning they stepped along
      side by side, almost quietly. They actually managed to take twenty paces
      at a time without pushing one another or laughing. They began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never can wake up,&rsquo; began Albine. &lsquo;I slept so soundly last night. Did
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed, very soundly,&rsquo; replied Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it mean when you dream of a bird that talks to you?&rsquo; the girl
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What did your bird say to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I have forgotten. But it said all kinds of things, and many of them
      sounded very comical. Stop, look at that big poppy over there. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      get it, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she sprang forward; but Serge, thanks to his long legs,
      outstripped her and plucked the poppy, which he waved about victoriously.
      She stood there with lips compressed, saying nothing, but feeling a strong
      inclination to cry. Serge threw down the flower. Nothing else occurred to
      him. Then, to make his peace with her, he asked: &lsquo;Would you like me to
      carry you as I did the other day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pouted a little, but she had not gone another thirty steps, when she
      turned round smiling. A bramble had caught hold of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it was you who were treading on my dress purposely. It won&rsquo;t
      let me go. Come and unfasten me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was released, they walked on again, side by side, very quietly.
      Albine pretended that it was much more amusing to stroll along in this
      fashion, like steady grown-up folks. They had just reached the meadows.
      Far away, in front of them, stretched grassy expanses scarce broken here
      and there by the tender foliage of willows. The grass looked soft and
      downy, like velvet. It was a deep green, subsiding in the distance into
      lighter tints, and on the horizon assuming a bright yellow glow beneath
      the flaring sun. The clumps of willows right over yonder seemed like pure
      gold, bathed in the tremulous brilliance of the sunshine. Dancing dust
      tipped the blades of grass with quivering light, and as the gentle breezes
      swept over the free expanse, moire-like reflections appeared on the
      caressed and quivering herbage. In the nearer fields a multitude of little
      white daisies, now in swarms, now straggling, and now in groups, like
      holiday makers at some public rejoicing, brightly peopled the dark grass.
      Buttercups showed themselves, gay like little brass bells which the touch
      of a fly&rsquo;s wing would set tinkling. Here and there big lonely poppies
      raised fiery cups, and others, gathered together further away, spread out
      like vats purple with lees of wine. Big cornflowers balanced aloft their
      light blue caps which looked as if they would fly away at every breath of
      air. Then under foot there were patches of woolly feather-grass and
      fragrant meadow-sweet, sheets of fescue, dog&rsquo;s-tail, creeping-bent, and
      meadow grass. Sainfoin reared its long fine filaments; clover unfurled its
      clear green leaves, plantains brandished forests of spears, lucerne spread
      out in soft beds of green satin broidered with purple flowers. And all
      these were seen, to right, to left, in front, everywhere, rolling over the
      level soil, showing like the mossy surface of a stagnant sea, asleep
      beneath the sky which ever seemed to expand. Here and there, in the vast
      expanse, the vegetation was of a limpid blue, as though it reflected the
      colour of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine and Serge stepped along over the meadow-lands, with the grass
      reaching to their knees. It was like wading through a pool. Now and then,
      indeed, they found themselves caught by a current in which a stream of
      bending stalks seemed to flow away between their legs. Then there were
      placid-looking, slumbering lakes, basins of short grass, which scarcely
      reached their ankles. As they walked along together, their joy found
      expression not in wild gambols, as in the orchard a week before, but
      rather in loitering, with their feet caught among the supple arms of the
      herbage, tasting as it were the caresses of a pure stream which calmed the
      exuberance of their youth. Albine turned aside and slipped into a lofty
      patch of vegetation which reached to her chin. Only her head appeared. For
      a moment or two she stood there in silence. Then she called to Serge:
      &lsquo;Come here, it is just like a bath. It is as if one had green water all
      over one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave a jump and scampered off without waiting for him, and they
      both walked along the margin of the first stream which barred their onward
      course. It was a shallow tranquil brook between banks of wild cress. It
      flowed on so placidly and gently that its surface reflected like a mirror
      the smallest reed that grew beside it. Albine and Serge followed this
      stream, whose onward motion was slower than their own, for a long time
      before they came across a tree that flung a long shadow upon the idle
      waters. As far as their eyes could reach they saw the bare brook stretch
      out and slumber in the sunlight like a blue serpent half uncoiled. At last
      they reached a clump of three willows. Two had their roots in the stream;
      the third was set a little backward. Their trunks, rotten and crumbling
      with age, were crowned with the bright foliage of youth. The shadow they
      cast was so slight as scarcely to be perceptible upon the sunlit bank. Yet
      here the water, which, both above and below, was so unruffled, showed a
      transient quiver, a rippling of its surface, as though it were surprised
      to find even this light veil cast over it. Between the three willows the
      meadow-land sloped down to the stream, and some crimson poppies had sprung
      up in the crevices of the decaying old trunks. The foliage of the willows
      looked like a tent of greenery fixed upon three stakes by the water&rsquo;s
      edge, beside a rolling prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the place,&rsquo; cried Albine, &lsquo;this is the place;&rsquo; and she glided
      beneath the willows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge sat down by her side, his feet almost in the water. He glanced round
      him, and murmured: &lsquo;You know everything, you know all the best spots. One
      might almost think this was an island, ten feet square, right in the
      middle of the sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed, we are quite at home,&rsquo; she replied, as she gleefully drummed
      the grass with her fists. &lsquo;It is altogether our own, and we are going to
      do everything ourselves.&rsquo; Then, as if struck by a brilliant idea, she
      sprang towards him, and, with her face close to his, asked him joyously:
      &lsquo;Will you be my husband? I will be your wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted at the notion, and replied that he would gladly be her
      husband, laughing even more loudly than she had done herself. Then Albine
      suddenly became grave, and assumed the anxious air of a housewife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that it is I who will have to give the orders. We
      will have breakfast as soon as you have laid the table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her orders in an imperious fashion. He had to stow all the
      various articles which she extracted from her pockets into a hole in one
      of the willows, which bole she called the cupboard. The rags supplied the
      household linen, while the comb represented the toilette necessaries. The
      needles and string were to be used for mending the explorers&rsquo; clothes.
      Provision for the inner man consisted of the little bottle of wine and a
      few crusts which she had saved from yesterday. She had, to be sure, some
      matches, by the aid of which she intended to cook the fish they were going
      to catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Serge had finished laying the table, the bottle of wine in the
      centre, and three crusts grouped round it, he hazarded the observation
      that the fare seemed to be scanty. But Albine shrugged her shoulders with
      feminine superiority. And wading into the water, she said in a severe
      tone, &lsquo;I will catch the fish; you can watch me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour she strenuously exerted herself in trying to catch some
      of the little fishes with her hands. She had gathered up her petticoats
      and fastened them together with a piece of string. And she advanced
      quietly into the water, taking the greatest care not to disturb it. When
      she was quite close to some tiny fish, that lay lurking between a couple
      of pebbles, she thrust down her bare arm, made a wild grasp, and brought
      her hand up again with nothing in it but sand and gravel. Serge then broke
      out into noisy laughter which brought her back to the bank, indignant. She
      told him that he had no business to laugh at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he ended by asking, &lsquo;how are we going to cook your fish when you
      have caught it? There is no wood about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That put the finishing touch to her discouragement. However, the fish in
      that stream didn&rsquo;t seem to be good for much; so she came out of the water
      and ran through the long grass to get her feet dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See,&rsquo; she suddenly exclaimed, &lsquo;here is some pimpernel. It is very nice.
      Now we shall have a feast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge was ordered to gather a quantity of the pimpernel and place it on
      the table. They ate it with their crusts. Albine declared that it was much
      better than nuts. She assumed the position of mistress of the
      establishment, and cut Serge&rsquo;s bread for him, for she would not trust him
      with the knife. At last she made him store away in the &lsquo;cupboard&rsquo; the few
      drops of wine that remained at the bottom of the bottle. He was also
      ordered to sweep the grass. Then Albine lay down at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are going to sleep now, you know. You must lie down by my side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did as he was ordered. They lay there stiffly staring into the air, and
      saying that they were asleep, and that it was very nice. After a while,
      however, they drew slightly away from one another, averting their heads as
      if they felt some discomfort. And at last breaking the silence which had
      fallen between them, Serge exclaimed: &lsquo;I love you very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was love such as it is without any sensual feeling; that instinctive
      love which wakens in the bosom of a little man ten years old at the sight
      of some white-robed baby-girl. The meadow-lands, spreading around them all
      open and free, dissipated the slight fear each felt of the other. They
      knew that they lay there, seen of all the herbage, that the blue sky
      looked down upon them through the light foliage of the willows, and the
      thought was pleasant to them. The willow canopy over their heads was a
      mere open screen. The shade it cast was so imperceptible that it wafted to
      them none of the languor that some dim coppice might have done. From the
      far-off horizon came a healthy breeze fraught with all the freshness of
      the grassy sea, swelling here and there into waves of flowers; while, at
      their feet, the stream, childlike as they were, flowed idly along with a
      gentle babbling that sounded to them like the laughter of a companion. Ah!
      happy solitude, so tranquil and placid, immensity wherein the little patch
      of grass serving as their couch took the semblance of an infant&rsquo;s cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough; said Albine, getting up; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve rested long
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge seemed a little surprised at this speedy termination of their sleep.
      He stretched out his arm and caught hold of Albine, as though to draw her
      near him again; and when she, laughing, dropped upon her knees he grasped
      her elbows and gazed up at her. He knew not to what impulse he was
      yielding. But when she had freed herself, and again had risen to her feet,
      he buried his face amongst the grass where she had lain, and which still
      retained the warmth of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;it is time to get up,&rsquo; and then he rose from the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They scoured the meadow-lands until evening began to fall. They went on
      and on, inspecting their garden. Albine walked in front, sniffing like a
      young dog, and saying nothing, but she was ever in search of the happy
      glade, although where they found themselves there were none of the big
      trees of which her thoughts were full. Serge meanwhile indulged in all
      kinds of clumsy gallantry. He rushed forward so hastily to thrust the tall
      herbage aside, that he nearly tripped her up; and he almost tore her arm
      from her body as he tried to assist her over the brooks. Their joy was
      great when they came to the three other streams. The first flowed over a
      bed of pebbles, between two rows of willows, so closely planted that they
      had to grope between the branches with the risk of falling into some deep
      part of the water. It only rose to Serge&rsquo;s knees, however, and having
      caught Albine in his arms he carried her to the opposite bank, to save her
      from a wetting. The next stream flowed black with shade beneath a lofty
      canopy of foliage, passing languidly onward with the gentle rustling and
      rippling of the satin train of some lady, dreamily sauntering through the
      woodland depths. It was a deep, cold, and rather dangerous-looking stream,
      but a fallen tree that stretched from bank to bank served them as a
      bridge. They crossed over, bestriding the tree with dangling feet, at
      first amusing themselves by stirring the water which looked like a mirror
      of burnished steel, but then suddenly hastening, frightened by the strange
      eyes which opened in the depths of the sleepy current at the slightest
      splash. But it was the last stream which delayed them the most. It was
      sportive like themselves, it flowed more slowly at certain bends, whence
      it started off again with merry ripples, past piles of big stones, into
      the shelter of some clump of trees, and grew calmer once more. It
      exhibited every humour as it sped along over soft sand or rocky boulders,
      over sparkling pebbles or greasy clay, where leaping frogs made yellow
      puddles. Albine and Serge dabbled about in delight, and even walked
      homewards through the stream in preference to remaining on the bank. At
      every little island that divided the current they landed. They conquered
      the savage spot or rested beneath the lofty canes and reeds, which seemed
      to grow there expressly as shelter for shipwrecked adventurers. Thus they
      made a delightful progress, amused by the changing scenery of the banks,
      enlivened by the merry humour of the living current.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they were about to leave the river, Serge realised that Albine
      was still seeking something along the banks, on the island, even among the
      plants that slept on the surface of the water. He was obliged to go and
      pull her from the midst of a patch of water-lilies whose broad leaves set
      <i>collerettes</i> around her limbs. He said nothing, but shook his finger
      at her. And at last they went home, walking along, arm in arm, like young
      people after a day&rsquo;s outing. They looked at each other, and thought one
      another handsomer and stronger than before, and of a certainty their
      laughter had a different ring from that with which it had sounded in the
      morning.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Are we never going out again?&rsquo; asked Serge some days later.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And when he saw Albine shrug her shoulders with a weary air, he added, in
      a teasing kind of way, &lsquo;You have got tired of looking for your tree,
      then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They joked about the tree all day and made fun of it. It didn&rsquo;t exist. It
      was only a nursery-story. Yet they both spoke of it with a slight feeling
      of awe. And on the morrow they settled that they would go to the far end
      of the park and pay a visit to the great forest-trees which Serge had not
      yet seen. Albine refused to take anything along with them. They
      breakfasted before starting and did not set off till late. The heat of the
      sun, which was then great, brought them a feeling of languor, and they
      sauntered along gently, side by side, seeking every patch of sheltering
      shade. They lingered neither in the garden nor the orchard, through which
      they had to pass. When they gained the shady coolness beneath the big
      trees, they dropped into a still slower pace; and, without a word, but
      with a deep sigh, as though it were welcome relief to escape from the
      glare of day, they pushed on into the forest&rsquo;s depths. And when they had
      nothing but cool green leaves about them, when no glimpse of the sunlit
      expanse was afforded by any gap in the foliage, they looked at each other
      and smiled, with a feeling of vague uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How nice it is here!&rsquo; murmured Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine simply nodded her head. A choking sensation in her throat prevented
      her from speaking. Their arms were not passed as usual round each other&rsquo;s
      waist, but swung loosely by their sides. They walked along without
      touching each other, and with their heads inclined towards the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge suddenly stopped short on seeing tears trickle down Albine&rsquo;s
      cheeks and mingle with the smile that played around her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with you?&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;are you in pain? Have you
      hurt yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m smiling? I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but the scent of
      all these trees forces tears into my eyes.&rsquo; She glanced at him, and then
      resumed: &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re crying too! You see you can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;all this deep shade affects one. It seems so
      peaceful, so mournful here that one feels a little sad. But you must tell
      me, you know, if anything makes you really unhappy. I have not done
      anything to annoy you, have I? you are not vexed with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him that she was not. She was quite happy, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why are you not enjoying yourself more? Shall we have a race?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! no, we can&rsquo;t race,&rsquo; she said, disdainfully, with a pout. And when he
      went on to suggest other amusements, such as bird-nesting or gathering
      strawberries or violets, she replied a little impatiently: &lsquo;We are too big
      for that sort of thing. It is childish to be always playing. Doesn&rsquo;t it
      please you better to walk on quietly by my side?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped along so prettily, that it was, indeed, a pleasure to hear the
      pit-pat of her little boots on the hard soil of the path. Never before had
      he paid attention to the rhythmic motion of her figure, the sweep of her
      skirts that followed her with serpentine motion. It was happiness never to
      be exhausted, to see her thus walking sedately by his side, for he was
      ever discovering some new charm in the lissom suppleness of her limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is really the best. I would walk by your
      side to the end of the world, if you wished it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further on, however, he asked her if she were not tired, and
      hinted that he would not be sorry to have a rest himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might sit down for a few minutes,&rsquo; he suggested in a stammering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we might lie down, you know, as we did in the meadows the other day.
      We should be quite comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t want to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she suddenly sprang aside, as if scared by the masculine arms
      outstretched towards her. Serge called her a big stupid, and tried to
      catch her. But at the light touch of his fingers she cried out with such
      an expression of pain that he drew back, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have hurt you?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply for a moment, surprised, herself, at her cry of fear,
      and already smiling at her own alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; leave me, don&rsquo;t worry me;&rsquo; and she added in a grave tone, though she
      tried to feign jocularity: &lsquo;you know that I have my tree to look for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Serge began to laugh, and offered to help her in her search. He
      conducted himself very gently in order that he might not again alarm her,
      for he saw that she was even yet trembling, though she had resumed her
      slow walk beside him. What they were contemplating was forbidden, and
      could bring them no luck; and he, like her, felt a delightful awe, which
      thrilled him at each repeated sigh of the forest trees. The perfume of the
      foliage, the soft green light which filtered through the leaves, the
      soughing silence of the undergrowth, filled them with tremulous
      excitement, as though the next turn of the path might lead them to some
      perilous happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for hours they walked on under the cool trees. They retained their
      reserved attitude towards each other, and scarcely exchanged a word,
      though they never left each other&rsquo;s side, but went together through the
      darkest greenery of the forest. At first their way lay through a jungle of
      saplings with trunks no thicker than a child&rsquo;s wrist. They had to push
      them aside, and open a path for themselves through the tender shoots which
      threw a wavy lacework of foliage before their eyes. The saplings closed up
      again behind them, leaving no trace of their passage, and they struggled
      on and on at random, ignorant of where they might be, and leaving nothing
      behind them to mark their progress, save a momentary waving of shaken
      boughs. Albine, weary of being unable to see more than three steps in
      front of her, was delighted when they at last found themselves free of
      this jungle, whose end they had long tried to discover. They had now
      reached a little clearing, whence several narrow paths, fringed with green
      hedges, struck out in various directions, twisting hither and thither,
      intersecting one another, bending and stretching in the most capricious
      fashion. Albine and Serge rose on tip-toes to peep over the hedges; but
      they were in no haste, and would willingly have stayed where they were,
      lost in the mazy windings, without ever getting anywhere, if they had not
      seen before them the proud lines of the lofty forest trees. They passed at
      last beneath their shade, solemnly and with a touch of sacred awe, as when
      one enters some vaulted cathedral. The straight lichen-stained trunks of
      the mighty trees, of a dingy grey, like discoloured stone, towered
      loftily, line by line, like a far-reaching infinity of columns. Naves
      opened far away, with lower, narrower aisles; naves strangely bold in
      their proportions, whose supporting pillars were very slender, richly
      caned, so finely chiselled that everywhere they allowed a glimpse of the
      blue heavens. A religious silence reigned beneath the giant arches, the
      ground below lay hard as stone in its austere nakedness; not a blade of
      green was there, nought but a ruddy dust of dead leaves. And Serge and
      Albine listened to their ringing footsteps as they went on, thrilled by
      the majestic solitude of this temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, indeed, if anywhere, must be the much-sought tree, beneath whose
      shade perfect happiness had made its home. They felt that it was nigh,
      such was the delight which stole through them amidst the dimness of those
      mighty arches. The trees seemed to be creatures of kindliness, full of
      strength and silence and happy restfulness. They looked at them one by
      one, and they loved them all; and they awaited from their majestic
      tranquillity some revelation whereby they themselves might grow, expand
      into the bliss of strong and perfect life. The maples, the ashes, the
      hornbeams, the cornels, formed a nation of giants, a multitude full of
      proud gentleness, who lived in peace, knowing that the fall of any one of
      them would have sufficed to wreck a whole corner of the forest. The elms
      displayed colossal bodies and limbs full of sap, scarce veiled by light
      clusters of little leaves. The birches and the alders, delicate as sylphs,
      swayed their slim figures in the breeze to which they surrendered the
      foliage that streamed around them like the locks of goddesses already half
      metamorphosed into trees. The planes shot up regularly with glossy
      tattooed bark, whence scaly fragments fell. Down a gentle slope descended
      the larches, resembling a band of barbarians, draped in <i>sayons</i> of
      woven greenery. But the oaks were the monarchs of all&mdash;the mighty
      oaks, whose sturdy trunks thrust out conquering arms that barred the sun&rsquo;s
      approach from all around them; Titan-like trees, oft lightning-struck,
      thrown back in postures like those of unconquered wrestlers, with
      scattered limbs that alone gave birth to a whole forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the tree which Serge and Albine sought be one of those colossal
      oaks? or was it one of those lovely planes, or one of those pale, maidenly
      birches, or one of those creaking elms? Albine and Serge still plodded on,
      unable to tell, completely lost amongst the crowding trees. For a moment
      they thought they had found the object of their quest in the midst of a
      group of walnut trees from whose thick foliage fell so cold a shadow that
      they shivered beneath it. Further on they felt another thrill of emotion
      as they came upon a little wood of chestnut trees, green with moss and
      thrusting out big strange-shaped branches, on which one might have built
      an aerial village. But further still Albine caught sight of a clearing,
      whither they both ran hastily. Here, in the midst of a carpet of fine
      turf, a locust tree had set a very toppling of greenery, a foliaged Babel,
      whose ruins were covered with the strangest vegetation. Stones, sucked up
      from the ground by the mounting sap, still remained adhering to the trunk.
      High branches bent down to earth again, and, taking root, surrounded the
      parent tree with lofty arches, a nation of new trunks which ever increased
      and multiplied. Upon the bark, seared with bleeding wounds, were ripening
      fruit-pods; the mere effort of bearing fruit strained the old monster&rsquo;s
      skin until it split. The young folks walked slowly round it, passing under
      the arched branches which formed as it were the streets of a city, and
      stared at the gaping cracks of the naked roots. Then they went off, for
      they had not felt there the supernatural happiness they sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; asked Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine did not know. She had never before come to this part of the park.
      They were now in a grove of cytisus and acacias, from whose clustering
      blossoms fell a soft, almost sugary perfume. &lsquo;We are quite lost,&rsquo; she
      laughed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know these trees at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the garden must come to an end somewhere,&rsquo; said Serge. &lsquo;When we get
      to the end, you will know where you are, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered, waving her hands afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into silence; never yet had the vastness of the park filled them
      with such pleasure. They joyed at knowing that they were alone in so
      far-spreading a domain that even they themselves could not reach its
      limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we are lost,&rsquo; said Serge, gaily; then humbly drawing near her he
      inquired: &lsquo;You are not afraid, are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! no. There&rsquo;s no one except you and me in the garden. What could I be
      afraid of? The walls are very high. We can&rsquo;t see them, but they guard us,
      you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge was now quite close to her, and he murmured, &lsquo;But a little time ago
      you were afraid of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him straight in the face, perfectly calm, without the least
      faltering in her glance. &lsquo;You hurt me,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;but you are
      different now. Why should I be afraid of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will let me hold you like this. We will go back under the
      trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you may put your arm around me, it makes me feel happy. And we&rsquo;ll
      walk slowly, eh? so that we may not find our way again too soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had passed his arm round her waist, and it was thus that they sauntered
      back to the shade of the great forest trees, under whose arching vaults
      they slowly went, with love awakening within them. Albine said that she
      felt a little tired, and rested her head on Serge&rsquo;s shoulder. The fabulous
      tree was now forgotten. They only sought to draw their faces nearer
      together that they might smile in one another&rsquo;s eyes. And it was the
      trees, the maples, the elms, the oaks, with their soft green shade, that
      whisperingly suggested to them the first words of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you!&rsquo; said Serge, while his breath stirred the golden hair that
      clustered round Albine&rsquo;s temples. He tried to think of other words, but he
      could only repeat, &lsquo;I love you! I love you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine listened with a delightful smile upon her face. The music of her
      heart was in accord with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you! I love you!&rsquo; she sighed, with all the sweetness of her soft
      young voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, lifting up her blue eyes, in which the light of love was dawning,
      she asked, &lsquo;How do you love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge reflected for a moment. The forest was wrapped in solemn quietude,
      the lofty naves quivered only with the soft footsteps of the young pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you beyond everything,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;You are more beautiful than
      all else that I see when I open my window in the morning. When I look at
      you, I want nothing more. If I could have you only, I should be perfectly
      happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her eyes, and swayed her head as if accompanying a strain of
      music. &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;I know nothing about you. I know not who
      you are, nor whence you came. You are neither my mother nor my sister; and
      yet I love you to a point that I have given you my whole heart and kept
      nought of it for others. Listen, I love those cheeks of yours, so soft and
      satiny; I love your mouth with its rose-sweet breath; I love your eyes, in
      which I see my own love reflected; I love even your eyelashes, even those
      little veins which blue the whiteness of your temples. Ah! yes, I love
      you, I love you, Albine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I love you, too,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;You are strong, and tall, and
      handsome. I love you, Serge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two they remained silent, enraptured. It seemed to them
      that soft, flute-like music went before them, that their own words came
      from some dulcet orchestra which they could not see. Shorter and shorter
      became their steps as they leaned one towards the other, ever threading
      their way amidst the mighty trees. Afar off through the long vista of the
      colonnades were glimpses of waning sunlight, showing like a procession of
      white-robed maidens entering church for a betrothal ceremony amid the low
      strains of an organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why do you love me?&rsquo; asked Albine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only smiled, and did not answer her immediately; then he said, &lsquo;I love
      you because you came to me. That expresses all.... Now we are together and
      we love one another. It seems to me that I could not go on living if I did
      not love you. You are the very breath of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head, speaking almost as though he were in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One does not know all that at first. It grows up in one as one&rsquo;s heart
      grows. One has to grow, one has to get strong.... Do you remember how we
      loved one another though we didn&rsquo;t speak of it? One is childish and silly
      at first. Then, one fine day, it all becomes clear, and bursts out. You
      see, we have nothing to trouble about; we love one another because our
      love and our life are one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine&rsquo;s head was cast back, her eyes were tightly closed, and she scarce
      drew her breath. Serge&rsquo;s caressing words enraptured her: &lsquo;Do you really,
      really love me?&rsquo; she murmured, without opening her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge remained silent, sorely troubled that he could find nothing further
      to say to prove to her the force of his love. His eyes wandered over her
      rosy face, which lay upon his shoulder with the restfulness of sleep. Her
      eyelids were soft as silk. Her moist lips were curved into a bewitching
      smile, her brow was pure white, with just a rim of gold below her hair. He
      would have liked to give his whole being with the word which seemed to be
      upon his tongue but which he could not utter. Again he bent over her, and
      seemed to consider on what sweet spot of that fair face he should whisper
      the supreme syllables. But he said nothing, he only breathed a little
      sigh. Then he kissed Albine&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albine, I love you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you, Serge!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they stopped short, thrilled, quivering with that first love kiss.
      She had opened her eyes quite widely. He was standing with his lips
      protruding slightly towards hers. They looked at each other without a
      blush. They felt they were under the influence of some sovereign power. It
      was like the realisation of a long dreamt-of meeting, in which they beheld
      themselves grown, made one for the other, for ever joined. For a moment
      they remained wondering, raising their eyes to the solemn vault of
      greenery above them, questioning the tranquil nation of trees as if
      seeking an echo of their kiss. But, beneath the serene complacence of the
      forest, they yielded to prolonged, ringing lovers&rsquo; gaiety, full of all the
      tenderness now born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me how long you have loved me. Tell me everything. Did you love me
      that day when you lay sleeping upon my hand? Did you love me when I fell
      out of the cherry tree, and you stood beneath it, stretching out your arms
      to catch me, and looking so pale? Did you love me when you took hold of me
      round the waist in the meadows to help me over the streams?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, let me speak. I have always loved you. And you, did you love me;
      did you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the evening closed round them they lived upon that one word &lsquo;love,&rsquo; 
      in which they ever seemed to find some new sweetness. They brought it into
      every sentence, ejaculated it inconsequentially, merely for the pleasure
      they found in pronouncing it. Serge, however, did not think of pressing a
      second kiss to Albine&rsquo;s lips. The perfume of the first sufficed them in
      their purity. They had found their way again, or rather had stumbled upon
      it, for they had paid no attention to the paths they took. As they left
      the forest, twilight had fallen, and the moon was rising, round and
      yellow, between the black foliage. It was a delightful walk home through
      the park, with that discreet luminary peering at them through the gaps in
      the big trees. Albine said that the moon was surely following them. The
      night was balmy, warm too with stars. Far away a long murmur rose from the
      forest trees, and Serge listened, thinking: &lsquo;They are talking of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the parterre, they passed through an atmosphere of
      sweetest perfumes; the perfume of flowers at night, which is richer, more
      caressing than by day, and seems like the very breath of slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night, Serge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night, Albine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They clasped each other by the hand on the landing of the first floor,
      without entering the room where they usually wished each other good night.
      They did not kiss. But Serge, when he was alone, remained seated on the
      edge of his bed, listening to Albine&rsquo;s every movement in the room above.
      He was weary with happiness, a happiness that benumbed his limbs.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the next few days Albine and Serge experienced a feeling of
      embarrassment. They avoided all allusion to their walk beneath the trees.
      They had not again kissed each other, or repeated their confession of
      love. It was not any feeling of shame which had sealed their lips, but
      rather a fear of in any way spoiling their happiness. When they were
      apart, they lived upon the dear recollection of love&rsquo;s awakening, plunged
      into it, passed once more through the happy hours which they had spent,
      with their arms around each other&rsquo;s waist, and their faces close together.
      It all ended by throwing them both into a feverish state. They looked at
      each other with heavy eyes, and talked, in a melancholy mood, of things
      that did not interest them in the least. Then, after a long interval of
      silence, Serge would say to Albine in a tone full of anxiety: &lsquo;You are
      ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head as she answered, &lsquo;No, no. It is you who are not
      well; your hands are burning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of the park filled them with vague uneasiness which they could
      not understand. They felt that danger lurked for them in some by-path, and
      would seize them and do them hurt. They never spoke about these
      disquieting thoughts, but certain timid glances revealed to them the
      mutual anguish which held them apart as though they were foes. One
      morning, however, Albine ventured, after much hesitation, to say to Serge:
      &lsquo;It is wrong of you to keep always indoors. You will fall ill again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge laughed in rather an embarrassed way. &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;we have
      been everywhere, we know all the garden by heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine shook her head, and in a whisper replied, &lsquo;No, no, we don&rsquo;t
      know the rocks, we have never been to the springs. It was there that I
      warmed myself last winter. There are some nooks where the stones seem to
      be actually alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, without having said another word on the subject, they
      set out together. They climbed up to the left behind the grotto where the
      marble woman lay slumbering; and as they set foot on the lowest stones,
      Serge remarked: &lsquo;We must see everything. Perhaps we shall feel quieter
      afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was very hot, there was thunder in the air. They had not ventured
      to clasp each other&rsquo;s waist; but stepped along, one behind the other,
      glowing beneath the sunlight. Albine took advantage of a widening of the
      path to let Serge go on in front; for the warmth of his breath upon her
      neck troubled her. All around them the rocks arose in broad tiers, storeys
      of huge flags, bristling with coarse vegetation. They first came upon
      golden gorse, clumps of sage, thyme, lavender, and other balsamic plants,
      with sour-berried juniper trees and bitter rosemary, whose strong scent
      made them dizzy. Here and there the path was hemmed in by holly, that grew
      in quaint forms like cunningly wrought metal work, gratings of blackened
      bronze, wrought iron, and polished copper, elaborately ornamented, covered
      with prickly <i>rosaces</i>. And before reaching the springs, they had to
      pass through a pine-wood. Its shadow seemed to weigh upon their shoulders
      like lead. The dry needles crackled beneath their feet, throwing up a
      light resinous dust which burned their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your garden doesn&rsquo;t make itself very agreeable just here,&rsquo; said Serge,
      turning towards Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They smiled at each other. They were now near the edge of the springs. The
      sight of the clear waters brought them relief. Yet these springs did not
      hide beneath a covering of verdure, like those that bubble up on the
      plains and set thick foliage growing around them that they may slumber
      idly in the shade. They shot up in the full light of day from a cavity in
      the rock, without a blade of grass near by to tinge the clear water with
      green. Steeped in the sunshine they looked silvery. In their depths the
      sun beat against the sand in a breathing living dust of light. And they
      darted out of their basin like arms of purest white, they rebounded like
      nude infants at play, and then suddenly leapt down in a waterfall whose
      curve suggested a woman&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dip your hands in,&rsquo; cried Albine; &lsquo;the water is icy cold at the bottom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed able to refresh their hot hands. They threw water over
      their faces too, and lingered there amidst the spray which rose up from
      the streaming springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; cried Albine; &lsquo;look, there is the garden, and there are the
      meadows and the forest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they looked at the Paradou spread out beneath their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you see,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;there isn&rsquo;t the least sign of any wall. The
      whole country belongs to us, right up to the sky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, almost unawares, they had slipped their arms round each
      other&rsquo;s waist. The coolness of the springs had soothed their feverish
      disquietude. But just as they were going away, Albine seemed to recall
      something and led Serge back again, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down there, below the rocks, a long time ago, I once saw the wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is nothing to be seen,&rsquo; replied Serge, turning a little pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes; it must be behind that avenue of chestnut trees on the other
      side of those bushes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on feeling Serge&rsquo;s arm tremble, she added: &lsquo;But perhaps I am
      mistaken.... Yet I seem to remember that I suddenly came upon it as I left
      the avenue. It stopped my way, and was so high that I felt a little
      afraid. And a few steps farther on, I came upon another surprise. There
      was a huge hole in it, through which I could see the whole country
      outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge looked at her with entreaty in his eyes. She gave a little shrug of
      her shoulders to reassure him, and went on: &lsquo;But I stopped the hole up; I
      have told you that we are quite alone, and we are. I stopped it up at
      once. I had my knife with me, and I cut down some brambles and rolled up
      some big stones. I would defy even a sparrow to force its way through. If
      you like, we will go and look at it one of these days, and then you will
      be satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head. Then they went away together, still holding each
      other by the waist; but they had grown anxious once more. Serge gazed down
      askance at Albine&rsquo;s face, and she felt perturbed beneath his glance. They
      would have liked to go down again at once, and thus escape the uneasiness
      of a longer walk. But, in spite of themselves, as though impelled by some
      stronger power, they skirted a rocky cliff and reached a table-land, where
      once more they found the intoxication of the full sunlight. They no longer
      inhaled the soft languid perfumes of aromatic plants, the musky scent of
      thyme, and the incense of lavender. Now they were treading a foul-smelling
      growth under foot; wormwood with bitter, penetrating smell; rue that
      reeked like putrid flesh; and hot valerian, clammy with aphrodisiacal
      exudations. Mandragoras, hemlocks, hellebores, dwales, poured forth their
      odours, and made their heads swim till they reeled and tottered one
      against the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I hold you up?&rsquo; Serge asked Albine, as he felt her leaning heavily
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was already pressing her in his arms, but she struggled out of his
      grasp, and drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; you stifle me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know what is the
      matter with me. The ground seems to give way under my feet. It is there I
      feel the pain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took hold of his hand and laid it upon her breast. Then Serge turned
      quite pale. He was even more overcome than she. And both had tears in
      their eyes as they saw each other thus ill and troubled, unable to think
      of a remedy for the evil which had fallen upon them. Were they going to
      die here of that mysterious, suffocating faintness?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and sit down in the shade,&rsquo; said Serge. &lsquo;It is these plants which
      are poisoning us with their noxious odours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her gently along by her finger-tips, for she shivered and trembled
      when he but touched her wrist. It was beneath a fine cedar, whose level
      roof-like branches spread nearly a dozen yards around, that she seated
      herself. Behind grew various quaint conifers; cypresses, with soft flat
      foliage that looked like heavy lace; spruce firs, erect and solemn, like
      ancient druidical pillars, still black with the blood of sacrificed
      victims; yews, whose dark robes were fringed with silver; evergreen trees
      of all kinds, with thick-set foliage, dark leathery verdure, splashed here
      and there with yellow and red. There was a weird-looking araucaria that
      stood out strangely with large regular arms resembling reptiles grafted
      one on the other, and bristling with imbricated leaves that suggested the
      scales of an excited serpent. In this heavy shade, the warm air lulled one
      to voluptuous drowsiness. The atmosphere slept, breathless; and a perfume
      of Eastern love, the perfume that came from the painted lips of the
      Shunamite, was exhaled by the odorous trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you not going to sit down?&rsquo; said Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she slipped a little aside to make room for him; but Serge stepped
      back and remained standing. Then, as she renewed her request, he dropped
      upon his knees, a little distance away, and said, softly: &lsquo;No, I am more
      feverish even than you are; I should make you hot. If I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
      hurting you, I would take you in my arms, and clasp you so tightly that we
      should no longer feel any pain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged himself nearer to her on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! to have you in my arms! In the night I awake from dreams in which I
      see you near me; but, alas! you are ever far away. There seems to be some
      wall built up between us which I can never beat down. And yet I am now
      quite strong again; I could catch you up in my arms and swing you over my
      shoulder, and carry you off as though you belonged to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had let himself sink upon his elbows, in an attitude of deep adoration.
      And he breathed a kiss upon the hem of Albine&rsquo;s skirt. But at this the
      girl sprang up, as though it was she herself that had received the kiss.
      She hid her brow with her hands, perturbed, quivering, and stammering
      forth: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t! I beg of you. Let us go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hurry away, but let Serge follow her as she walked slowly on,
      stumbling against the roots of the plants, and with her hands still
      clasped round her head, as though to check the excitement that thrilled
      her. When they came out of the little wood, they took a few steps over
      ledges of rocks, on which a whole nation of ardent fleshy plants was
      squatting. It was like a crawling, writhing assemblage of hideous nameless
      monsters such as people a nightmare; monsters akin to spiders,
      caterpillars, and wood-lice, grown to gigantic proportions, some with bare
      glaucous skins, others tufted with filthy matted hairs, whilst many had
      sickly limbs&mdash;dwarf legs, and shrivelled, palsied arms&mdash;sprawling
      around them. And some displayed horrid dropsical bellies; some had spines
      bossy with hideous humps, and others looked like dislocated skeletons.
      Mamillaria threw up living pustules, a crawling swarm of greenish
      tortoises, bristling hideously with long hairs that were stiffer than
      iron. The echinocacti, which showed more flesh, suggested nests of young
      writhing, knotted vipers. The echinopses were mere excrescent red-haired
      growths that made one think of huge insects rolled into balls. The
      prickly-pears spread out fleshy leaves spotted with ruddy spikes that
      resembled swarms of microscopic bees. The gasterias sprawled about like
      big shepherd-spiders turned over on their backs, with long-speckled and
      striated legs. The cacti of the cereus family showed a horrid vegetation,
      huge polyps, the diseases of an overheated soil, the maladies of poisoned
      sap. But the aloes, languidly unfolding their hearts, were particularly
      numerous and conspicuous. Among them one found every possible tint of
      green, pale green and vivid, yellowish green and greyish, browny green,
      dashed with a ruddy tone, and deep green, fringed with pale gold. And the
      shapes of their leaves were as varied as their tints. Some were broad and
      heart-shaped, others were long and narrow like sword-blades; some bristled
      with spikey thorns, while yet others looked as though they had been
      cunningly hemmed at the edges. There were giant ones, in lonely majesty,
      with flower stalks that towered up aloft like poles wreathed with rosy
      coral; and there were tiny ones clustering thickly together on one and the
      same stem, and throwing forth on all sides leaves that gleamed and
      quivered like adders&rsquo; tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us go back to the shade,&rsquo; begged Serge. &lsquo;You can sit down there as
      you did just now, and I will lie at your feet and talk to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Where they stood the sun rays fell like torrential rain. It was as if the
      triumphant orb seized upon the shadowless ground, and strained it to his
      blazing breast. Albine grew faint, staggered, and turned to Serge for
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moment they felt each other&rsquo;s touch, they fell together without
      even a word. It was as though the very rock beneath them had opened, as
      though they were ever going down and down. Their hands sought each other
      caressingly, embracingly, but such keen anguish did they experience that
      they suddenly tore themselves apart, and fled, each in a different
      direction. Serge did not cease running till he had reached the pavilion,
      and had thrown himself upon his bed, his brain on fire, and despair in his
      heart. Albine did not return till nightfall, after hours of weeping in a
      corner of the garden. It was the first time that they had not returned
      home together, tired after their long wanderings. For three days they kept
      apart, feeling terribly unhappy.

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yet now the park was entirely their own. They had taken sovereign
      possession of it. There was not a corner of it that was not theirs to use
      as they willed. For them alone the thickets of roses put forth their
      blossoms, and the parterre exhaled its soft perfume, which lulled them to
      sleep as they lay at night with their windows open. The orchard provided
      them with food, filling Albine&rsquo;s skirts with fruits, and spread over them
      the shade of its perfumed boughs, under which it was so pleasant to
      breakfast in the early morning. Away in the meadows the grass and the
      streams were all theirs; the grass, which extended their kingdom to such
      boundless distance, spreading an endless silky carpet before them; and the
      streams, which were the best of their joys, emblematic of their own purity
      and innocence, ever offering them coolness and freshness in which they
      delighted to bathe their youth. The forest, too, was entirely theirs, from
      the mighty oaks, which ten men could not have spanned, to the slim birches
      which a child might have snapped; the forest, with all its trees, all its
      shade, all its avenues and clearings, its cavities of greenery, of which
      the very birds themselves were ignorant; the forest which they used as
      they listed, as if it were a giant canopy, beneath which they might
      shelter from the noontide heat their new-born love. They reigned
      everywhere, even among the rocks and the springs, even over that gruesome
      stretch of ground that teemed with such hideous growth, and which had
      seemed to sink and give way beneath their feet, but which they loved yet
      even more than the soft grassy couches of the garden, for the strange
      thrill of passion they had felt there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, now, in front of them, behind them, to the right of them and to the
      left, all was theirs. They had gained possession of the whole domain, and
      they walked through a friendly expanse which knew them, and smiled kindly
      greetings to them as they passed, devoting itself to their pleasure, like
      a faithful and submissive servitor. The sky, with its vast canopy of blue
      overhead, was also theirs to enjoy. The park walls could not enclose it,
      their eyes could ever revel in its beauty, and it entered into the joy of
      their life, at daytime with its triumphal sun, at night with its golden
      rain of stars. At every moment of the day it delighted them afresh, its
      expression ever varying. In the early morning it was pale as a maiden just
      risen from her slumber; at noon, it was flushed, radiant as with a longing
      for fruitfulness, and in the evening it became languid and breathless, as
      after keen enjoyment. Its countenance was constantly changing.
      Particularly in the evenings, at the hour of parting, did it delight them.
      The sun, hastening towards the horizon, ever found a fresh smile.
      Sometimes he disappeared in the midst of serene calmness, unflecked by a
      single cloud, sinking gradually beneath a golden sea. At other times he
      threw out crimson glories, tore his vaporous robe to shreds, and set
      amidst wavy flames that streaked the skies like the tails of gigantic
      comets, whose radiant heads lit up the crests of the forest trees. Then,
      again, extinguishing his rays one by one, he would softly sink to rest on
      shores of ruddy sand, far-reaching banks of blushing coral; and then, some
      other night, he would glide away demurely behind a heavy cloud that
      figured the grey hangings of some alcove, through which the eye could only
      detect a spark like that of a night-light. Or else he would rush to his
      couch in a tumult of passion, rolled round with white forms which
      gradually crimsoned beneath his fiery embraces, and finally disappeared
      with him below the horizon in a confused chaos of gleaming, struggling
      limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the plants which had not made their submission. Albine and
      Serge passed like monarchs through the kingdom of animals, who rendered
      them humble and loyal obeisance. When they crossed the parterre, flights
      of butterflies arose to delight their eyes, to fan them with quivering
      wings, and to follow in their train like living sunbeams or flying
      blossoms. In the orchard, they were greeted by the birds that banqueted in
      the fruit-trees. The sparrows, the chaffinches, the golden orioles, the
      bullfinches, showed them the ripest fruit scarred by their hungry beaks;
      and while they sat astride the branches and breakfasted, birds twittered
      and sported round them like children at play, and even purloined the fruit
      beneath their very feet. Albine found even more amusement in the meadows,
      where she caught the little green frogs with eyes of gold, that lay
      squatting amongst the reeds, absorbed in contemplation; while Serge, with
      a piece of straw, poked the crickets out of their hiding-places, or
      tickled the grasshoppers to make them sing. He picked up insects of all
      colours, blue ones, red ones, yellow ones, and set them creeping upon his
      sleeve, where they gleamed and glittered like buttons of sapphire and ruby
      and topaz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was all the mysterious life of the streams; the grey-backed
      fishes that threaded the dim waters, the eels whose presence was betrayed
      by a slight quivering of the water-plants, the young fry, which dispersed
      like blackish sand at the slightest sound, the long-legged flies and the
      water-beetles that ruffled into circling silvery ripples the stagnant
      surface of the pools; all that silent teeming life which drew them to the
      water and impelled them to dabble and stand in it, so that they might feel
      those millions of existences ever and ever gliding past their limbs. At
      other times, when the day was hot and languid, they would betake
      themselves beneath the voiceful shade of the forest and listen to the
      serenades of their musicians, the clear fluting of the nightingales, the
      silvery bugle-notes of the tomtits, and the far-off accompaniment of the
      cuckoos. They gazed with delight upon the swift flight of the pheasants,
      whose plumes gleamed like sudden sun rays amidst the branches, and with a
      smile they stayed their steps to let a troop of young roebucks bound past,
      or else a couple of grave stags that slackened their pace to look at them.
      Again, on other days they would climb up amongst the rocks, when the sun
      was blazing in the heavens, and find a pleasure in watching the swarms of
      grasshoppers which at the sound of their footsteps arose with a great
      crepitation of wings from the beds of thyme. The snakes that lay uncoiled
      beneath the parched bushes, or the lizards that sprawled over the red-hot
      stones, watched them with friendly eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the life that thus teemed round them in the park, Albine and Serge
      had only become really conscious since the day when a kiss had awakened
      them to life themselves. Now it deafened them at times, and spoke to them
      in a language which they did not understand. It was that life&mdash;all
      the voices of the animal creation, all the perfumes and soft shadows of
      the flowers and trees&mdash;which perturbed them to such a point as to
      make them angry with one another. And yet throughout the whole park they
      found nothing but loving familiarity. Every plant and every creature was
      their friend. All the Paradou was one great caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had come thither, the sun had for a whole century reigned over
      it in lonely majesty. The garden, then, had known no other master; it had
      beheld him, every morning, scaling the boundary wall with his slanting
      rays, at noontide it had seen him pour his vertical heat upon the panting
      soil; and at evening it had seen him go off, on the other side, with a
      kiss of farewell upon its foliage. And so the garden had no shyness; it
      welcomed Albine and Serge, as it had so long welcomed the sun, as pleasant
      companions, with whom one puts on no ceremony. The animals, the trees, the
      streams, the rocks, all continued in an unrestrained state of nature,
      speaking aloud, living openly, without a secret, displaying the innocent
      shamelessness, the hearty tenderness of the world&rsquo;s first days. Serge and
      Albine, however, suffered from these voluptuous surroundings, and at times
      felt minded to curse the garden. On the afternoon when Albine had wept so
      bitterly after their saunter amongst the rocks, she had called out to the
      Paradou, whose intensity of life and passion filled her with distress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you really be our friend, why, why do you make us so wretched?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Serge barricaded himself in his room. The perfume from
      the garden irritated him. He drew the calico curtains closely across the
      window to shut out the sight of the park. Perhaps he thought he might
      recover all his old serenity and calm if he shut himself off from that
      greenery, whose shade sent such passionate thrills quivering through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long hours they spent together, Albine and he never now spoke
      of the rocks or the streams, the trees or the sky. The Paradou might no
      longer have been in existence. They strove to forget it. And yet they were
      all the time conscious of its presence on the other side of those slight
      curtains. Scented breezes forced their way in through the interstices of
      the window frame, the many voices of nature made the panes resound. All
      the life of the park laughed, chattered, and whispered in ambush beneath
      their window. As it reached them their cheeks would pale and they would
      raise their voices, seeking some occupation which might prevent them from
      hearing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you noticed,&rsquo; said Serge one morning during these uneasy intervals,
      &lsquo;there is a painting of a woman over the door there? She is like you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed noisily as he finished speaking. They both turned to the
      paintings and dragged the table once more alongside the wall, with a
      nervous desire to occupy themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; murmured Albine. &lsquo;She is much fatter than I am. But one can&rsquo;t
      see her very well; her position is so queer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They relapsed into silence. From the decayed, faded painting a scene,
      which they had never before noticed, now showed forth. It was as if the
      picture had taken shape and substance again beneath the influence of the
      summer heat. You could sea a nymph with arms thrown back and pliant figure
      on a bed of flowers which had been strewn for her by young cupids, who,
      sickle in hand, ever added fresh blossoms to her rosy couch. And nearer,
      you could also see a cloven-hoofed faun who had surprised her thus. But
      Albine repeated, &lsquo;No, she is not like me, she is very plain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge said nothing. He looked at the girl and then at Albine, as though he
      were comparing them one with the other. Albine pulled up one of her
      sleeves, as if to show that her arm was whiter than that of the pictured
      girl. Then they subsided into silence again, and gazed at the painting;
      and for a moment Albine&rsquo;s large blue eyes turned to Serge&rsquo;s grey ones,
      which were glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have got all the room painted again, then?&rsquo; she cried, as she sprang
      from the table. &lsquo;These people look as though they were all coming to life
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to laugh, but there was a nervous ring about their merriment as
      they glanced at the nude and frisking cupids which started to life again
      on all the panels. They no longer took those survivals of voluptuous
      eighteenth century art to represent mere children at play. They were
      disturbed by the sight of them, and as Albine felt Serge&rsquo;s hot breath on
      her neck she started and left his side to seat herself on the sofa. &lsquo;They
      frighten me,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;The men are like robbers, and the women, with
      their dying eyes, look like people who are being murdered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge sat down in a chair, a little distance away, and began to talk of
      other matters. But they remained uneasy. They seemed to think that all
      those painted figures were gazing at them. It was as if the trooping
      cupids were springing out of the panelling, casting the flowers they held
      around them, and threatening to bind them together with the blue ribbons
      which already enchained two lovers in one corner of the ceiling. And the
      whole story of the nymph and her faun lover, from his first peep at her to
      his triumph among the flowers, seemed to burst into warm life. Were all
      those lovers, all those impudent shameless cupids about to step down from
      their panels and crowd around them? They already seemed to hear their
      panting sighs, and to feel their breath filling the spacious room with the
      perfume of voluptuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite suffocating, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; sighed Albine. &lsquo;In spite of every
      airing I have given it, the room has always seemed close to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other night,&rsquo; said Serge, &lsquo;I was awakened by such a penetrating
      perfume, that I called out to you, thinking you had come into the room. It
      was just like the soft warmth of your hair when you have decked it with
      heliotropes.... In the earlier times it seemed to be wafted to me from a
      distance, it was like the lingering memory of a perfume; but now I can&rsquo;t
      sleep for it, and it is so strong and penetrating that it quite stupefies
      me. The alcove grows so hot, too, at night that I shall be obliged to lie
      on the couch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine laid her fingers on her lips, and whispered, &lsquo;It is the dead girl&mdash;she
      who once lived here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They sniffed the odorous air with forced gaiety, but in reality feeling
      very troubled. Certainly never before had the room exhaled such a
      disquieting aroma. The very walls seemed to be still echoing the faint
      rustling of perfumed skirts; and the floor had retained the fragrance of
      satin slippers dropped by the bedside, and near the head of the bed itself
      Serge thought he could trace the imprint of a little hand, which had left
      behind it a clinging scent of violets. Over all the furniture the phantom
      presence of the dead girl still lingered fragrantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See, this is the armchair where she used to sit,&rsquo; cried Albine; &lsquo;there is
      the scent of her shoulders at the back of it yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in it herself, and bade Serge drop upon his knees and kiss
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember the day when I first let you in and said, &ldquo;Good morrow, my
      dear lord!&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t all, was it? He kissed her hands when the door
      was closed. There they are, my hands. They are yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they tried to resume their old frolics in order that they might
      forget the Paradou, whose joyous murmur they heard ever rising outside,
      and that they might no longer think of the pictures nor yield to the
      languor-breathing influence of the room. Albine put on an affected manner,
      leant back in her chair, and finally laughed at the foolish figure which
      Serge made at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You stupid!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;take me round the waist, and say pretty things to
      me, since you are supposed to be in love with me. Don&rsquo;t you know how to
      make love then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as she felt him clasp her with eager impetuosity, she began to
      struggle, and freed herself from his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; leave me alone. I can&rsquo;t bear it. I feel as though I were choking
      in this room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day forward they felt the same kind of fear for the room as they
      already felt for the garden. Their one remaining harbour of refuge was now
      a place to be shunned and dreaded, a spot where they could no longer find
      themselves together without watching each other furtively. Albine now
      scarcely ventured to enter it, but remained near the threshold, with the
      door wide open behind her so as to afford her an immediate retreat. Serge
      lived there in solitude, a prey to sickening restlessness, half-stifling,
      lying on the couch and vainly trying to close his ears to the sighs of the
      soughing park and his nostrils to the haunting fragrance of the old
      furniture. At night he dreamt wild passionate dreams, which left him in
      the morning nervous and disquieted. He believed that he was falling ill
      again, that he would never recover plenitude of health. For days and days
      he remained there in silence, with dark rings round his sleepy eyes, only
      starting into wakefulness when Albine came to visit him. They would remain
      face to face, gazing at one another sadly, and uttering but a few soft
      words, which seemed to choke them. Albine&rsquo;s eyes were even darker than
      Serge&rsquo;s, and were filled with an imploring gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a week had gone by, Albine&rsquo;s visit never lasted more than a
      few minutes. She seemed to shun him. When she came to the room, she
      appeared thoughtful, remained standing, and hurried off as soon as
      possible. When he questioned her about this change in her demeanour
      towards him, and reproached her for no longer being friendly, she turned
      her head away and avoided replying. He never could get her to tell him how
      she spent the mornings that she passed alone. She would only shake her
      head, and talk about being very idle. If he pressed her more closely, she
      bounded out of the room, just wishing him a hasty good-night as she
      disappeared through the doorway. He often noticed, however, that she had
      been crying. He observed, too, in her expression the phases of a hope that
      was never fulfilled, the perpetual struggling of a desire eager to be
      satisfied. Sometimes she seemed quite overwhelmed with melancholy,
      dragging herself about with an air of utter discouragement, like one who
      no longer had any pleasure in living. At other times she laughed lightly,
      her face shone with an expression of triumphant hope, of which, however,
      she would not yet speak, and her feet could not remain still, so eager was
      she to dart away to what seemed to her some last certainty. But on the
      following day, she would sink again into desperation, to soar afresh on
      the morrow on the pinions of renewed hope. One thing which she could not
      conceal from Serge was that she suffered from extreme lassitude. Even
      during the few moments they spent together she could not prevent her head
      from nodding, or keep herself from dozing off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, recognising that she was unwilling to reply, had ceased to question
      her; and, when she now entered his room, he contented himself with casting
      an anxious glance at her, fearful lest some evening she should no longer
      have strength enough to come to him. Where could she thus reduce herself
      to such exhaustion? What perpetual struggle was it that brought about
      those alternations of joy and despair? One morning he started at the sound
      of a light footfall beneath his window. It could not be a roe venturing
      abroad in that manner. Moreover he could recognise that light footfall.
      Albine was wandering about the Paradou without him. It was from the
      Paradou that she returned to him with all those hopes and fears and inward
      wrestlings, all that lassitude which was killing her. And he could well
      guess what she was seeking out there, alone in the woody depths, with all
      the silent obstinacy of a woman who has vowed to effect her purpose. After
      that he used to listen for her steps. He dared not draw aside the curtain
      and watch her as she hurried along through the trees; but he experienced
      strange, almost painful emotion, in listening to ascertain what direction
      she took, whether she turned to right or to left, whether she went
      straight on through the flower-beds, and how far her ramble extended.
      Amidst all the noisy life of the Paradou, amidst the soughing chorus of
      the trees, the rustling of the streams, and the ceaseless songs of the
      birds, he could distinguish the gentle pit-pat of her shoes so plainly
      that he could have told whether she was stepping over the gravel near the
      rivers, the crumbling mould of the forest, or the bare ledges of the
      rocks. In time he even learned to tell, from the sound of her nervous
      footfall, whether she came back hopeful or depressed. As soon as he heard
      her step on the staircase, he hurried from the window, and he never let
      her know that he had thus followed her from afar in her wanderings. But
      she must have guessed it, for with a glance she always afterwards told him
      where she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay indoors, and don&rsquo;t go out,&rsquo; he begged her, with clasped hands, one
      morning when he saw her still unrecovered from the fatigue of the previous
      day. &lsquo;You drive me to despair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she hastened away in irritation. The garden, now that it rang with
      Albine&rsquo;s footfalls, seemed to have a more depressing influence than ever
      upon Serge. The pit-pat of her feet was yet another voice that called him;
      an imperious voice that echoed ever more and more loudly within him. He
      closed his ears and tried to shut out the sound, but the distant footsteps
      still echoed to him in the throbbings of his heart. And when she came
      back, in the evening, it was the whole park that came back with her, with
      the memories of their walks together, and of the slow dawn of their love,
      in the midst of conniving nature. She seemed to have grown taller and
      graver, mellowed, matured by her solitary rambles. There was nothing left
      in her of the frolicsome child, and his teeth would suddenly set at times
      when he looked at her and beheld her so desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, about noon, Serge heard Albine returning in hot haste. He had
      restrained himself from listening for her steps when she went away.
      Usually, she did not return till late, and he was amazed at her
      impetuosity as she sped along, forcing her way through the branches that
      barred her path. As she passed beneath his window, he heard her laugh; and
      as she mounted the stairway, she panted so heavily that he almost thought
      he could feel her hot breath streaming against his face. She threw the
      door wide open, and cried out: &lsquo;I have found it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sat down and repeated softly, breathlessly: &lsquo;I have found it! I
      have found it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, distracted, laid his fingers on her lips, and stammered: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      tell me anything, I beg you. I want to know nothing of it. It will kill
      me, if you speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sank into silence with gleaming eyes and lips tightly pressed
      lest the words she kept back should spring out in spite of her. And she
      stayed in the room till evening, trying to meet Serge&rsquo;s glance, and
      imparting to him, each time that their eyes met, something of that which
      she had discovered. Her whole face beamed with radiance, she exhaled a
      delicious odour, she was full of life; and Serge felt that she permeated
      him through all his senses. Despairingly did he struggle against this
      gradual invasion of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow she returned to his room as soon as she was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going out?&rsquo; he asked, conscious that he would be vanquished
      should she remain there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said; she wasn&rsquo;t going out any more. As by degrees she recovered
      from her fatigue he felt her becoming stronger, more triumphant. She would
      soon be able to take him by the hand and drag him to that spot, whose
      charm her silence proclaimed so loudly. That day, however, she did not
      speak; she contented herself with keeping him seated on a cushion at her
      feet. It was not till the next morning that she ventured to say: &lsquo;Why do
      you shut yourself up here? It is so pleasant under the trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from her feet, and stretched out his arms entreatingly. But she
      laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, then, we won&rsquo;t go out, since you would rather not.... But
      this room has such a strange scent, and we should be much more comfortable
      in the garden. It is very wrong of you to have taken such a dislike to
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had again settled himself at her feet in silence, his eyelids lowered,
      his features quivering with passionate emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t go out,&rsquo; she repeated, &lsquo;so don&rsquo;t worry. But do you really prefer
      these pictures to the grass and flowers in the park? Do you remember all
      we saw together? It is these paintings which make us feel so unhappy. They
      are a nuisance, always looking and watching us as they do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Serge gradually leant more closely against her, she passed her arm
      round his neck and laid his head upon her lap, while murmuring in yet a
      lower tone: &lsquo;There is a little corner there I know, where we might be so
      very happy. Nothing would trouble us there; the fresh air would cool your
      feverishness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stopped, as she felt him quivering. She was afraid lest she might
      again revive his old fears. But she gradually conquered him merely by the
      caressing gaze of her blue eyes. His eyelids were now raised, and he
      rested there quietly, wholly hers, his tremor past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! if you only knew!&rsquo; she softly breathed; and seeing that he continued
      to smile, she went on boldly: &lsquo;It is all a lie; it is not forbidden. You
      are a man now and ought not to be afraid. If we went there, and any danger
      threatened me, you would protect me, you would defend me, would you not?
      You could carry me off on your back, couldn&rsquo;t you? I am never the least
      afraid when I have you with me. Look how strong your arms have grown. What
      is there for any one with such strong arms as yours to be afraid of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She caressed him beguilingly as she spoke, stroking his hair and neck and
      shoulders with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not forbidden,&rsquo; she resumed. &lsquo;That is only a story for stupids,
      and was invented, long ago, by some one who didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed in
      the most charming spot in the whole garden. As soon as you sat down on
      that grassy carpet, you would be happy and well again. Listen, then, come
      with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head but without any sign of vexation, as though indeed he
      liked thus being teased. Then after a short silence, grieved to see her
      pouting, and longing for a renewal of her caresses, he opened his lips and
      asked: &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him immediately. Her eyes seemed to be wandering far
      away: &lsquo;It is over yonder,&rsquo; she murmured at last. &lsquo;I cannot explain to you
      clearly. One has to go down the long avenue, and then to turn to the left,
      and then again to the left. We must have passed it at least a score of
      times. You might look for it for ever without finding it, if I didn&rsquo;t go
      with you to show you. I could find my way to it quite straight, though I
      could never explain it to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who took you there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That morning the trees and plants seemed to drive me there.
      The long branches pushed me on, the grass bent down before me invitingly,
      the paths seemed to open expressly for me to take them. And I believe the
      animals themselves helped to lead me there, for I saw a stag trotting on
      before me as though he wanted me to follow; while a company of bullfinches
      flitted on from tree to tree, and warned me with their cries whenever I
      was about to take a wrong direction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is it very beautiful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she did not reply. Deep ecstasy filled her eyes; at last, when she
      was able to speak again, she said: &lsquo;Ah! so beautiful, that I could never
      tell you of it. I was so charmed that I was conscious only of some supreme
      joy, which I could not name, falling from the leaves and slumbering amid
      the grass. And I ran back here to take you along with me that I might not
      be without you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she clasped her arms round his neck again, and entreated him
      passionately, her lips almost pressed to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you will come!&rsquo; she stammered; &lsquo;you must come; you will make me so
      miserable if you don&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t want me to be miserable.... And even if
      you knew that you would die there, even if that shade should be fatal to
      both of us, would you hesitate or cast a regretful look behind? We should
      remain there, at the foot of the tree, and sleep on quietly for ever, in
      one anther&rsquo;s arms. Ah! would it not be bliss indeed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; he stammered, transported by her passionate entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we shall not die,&rsquo; she continued, raising her voice, and laughing
      with the laugh which proclaims woman&rsquo;s victory; &lsquo;we shall live to love
      each other. It is a tree of life, a tree whose shadow will make us
      stronger, more perfect, more complete. You will see that all will now go
      happily. Some blessed joy will assuredly descend on us from heaven! Will
      you come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face paled, and his eyelids quivered, as though too powerful a light
      were suddenly beating against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come? will you come?&rsquo; she cried again, yet more passionately,
      and already half rising to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up and followed her, at first with tottering steps and then with
      his arm thrown round her waist, as if he could endure no separation from
      her. He went where she went, carried along in the warm fragrance that
      streamed from her hair. And as he thus remained slightly in the rear, she
      turned upon him a face so radiant with love, such tempting lips and eyes,
      which so imperiously bade him follow, that he would have gone with her
      anywhere, trusting and unquestioning, like a dog.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      They went down and out into the garden without the smile fading from
      Serge&rsquo;s face. All that he saw of the greenery around him was such as was
      reflected in the clear depths of Albine&rsquo;s eyes. As they approached, the
      garden smiled and smiled again, a murmur of content sped from leaf to leaf
      and from bough to bough to the furthest depths of the avenues. For days
      and days the garden must have been hoping and expecting to see them thus,
      clinging to one another, making their peace again with the trees and
      searching for their lost love on the grassy banks. A solemn warning breath
      sighed through the branches; the afternoon sky was drowsy with heat; the
      plants raised their bowing heads to watch them pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; whispered Albine. &lsquo;They drop into silence as we come near them;
      but over yonder they are expecting us, they are telling each other the way
      they must lead us.... I told you we should have no trouble about the
      paths, the trees themselves will direct us with their spreading arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole park did, indeed, appear to be impelling them gently onward. In
      their rear it seemed as if a barrier of brush-wood had bristled up to
      prevent them from retracing their steps; while, in front of them, the
      grassy lawns spread out so invitingly, that they glided along the soft
      slopes, without thought of choosing their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the birds are coming with us, too,&rsquo; said Albine. &lsquo;It is the tomtits
      this time. Don&rsquo;t you see them? They are skimming over the hedges, and they
      stop at each turning to see that we don&rsquo;t lose our way.&rsquo; Then she added:
      &lsquo;All the living things of the park are with us. Can&rsquo;t you hear them? There
      is a deep rustling close behind us. It is the birds in the trees, the
      insects in the grass, the roebucks and the stags in the coppices, and even
      the little fishes splashing the quiet water with their beating fins. Don&rsquo;t
      turn round, or you will frighten them. Ah! I am sure we have a rare train
      behind us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They still walked on, unfatigued. Albine spoke only to charm Serge with
      the music of her voice, while Serge obeyed the slightest pressure of her
      hand. They knew not what they passed, but they were certain that they were
      going straight towards their goal. And as they went along, the garden
      became gradually graver, more discreet; the soughing of the branches died
      away, the streams hushed their plashing waters, the birds, the beasts, and
      the insects fell into silence. All around them reigned solemn stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Albine and Serge instinctively raised their heads. In front of them
      they beheld a colossal mass of foliage; and, as they hesitated for a
      moment, a roe, after gazing at them with its sweet soft eyes, bounded into
      the thickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is there,&rsquo; said Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way, her face again turned towards Serge, whom she drew with
      her, and they disappeared amid the quivering leaves, and all grew quiet
      again. They were entering into delicious peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre there stood a tree covered with so dense a foliage that one
      could not recognise its species. It was of giant girth, with a trunk that
      seemed to breathe like a living breast, and far-reaching boughs that
      stretched like protecting arms around it. It towered up there beautiful,
      strong, virile, and fruitful. It was the king of the garden, the father of
      the forest, the pride of the plants, the beloved of the sun, whose
      earliest and latest beams smiled daily on its crest. From its green vault
      poured all the joys of creation: fragrance of flowers, music of birds,
      gleams of golden light, wakeful freshness of dawn, slumbrous warmth of
      evening twilight. So strong was the sap that it burst through the very
      bark, bathing the tree with the powers of fruitfulness, making it the
      symbol of earth&rsquo;s virility. Its presence sufficed to give the clearing an
      enchanting charm. The other trees built up around it an impenetrable wall,
      which isolated it as in a sanctuary of silence and twilight. There was but
      greenery there, not a scrap of sky, not a glimpse of horizon; nothing but
      a swelling rotunda, draped with green silkiness of leaves, adorned below
      with mossy velvet. And one entered, as into the liquid crystal of a
      source, a greenish limpidity, a sheet of silver reposing beneath reflected
      reeds. Colours, perfumes, sounds, quivers, all were vague, indeterminate,
      transparent, steeped in a felicity amidst which everything seemed to faint
      away. Languorous warmth, the glimmer of a summer&rsquo;s night, as it fades on
      the bare shoulder of some fair girl, a scarce perceptible murmur of love
      sinking into silence, lingered beneath the motionless branches, unstirred
      by the slightest zephyr. It was hymeneal solitude, a chamber where Nature
      lay hidden in the embraces of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine and Serge stood there in an ecstasy of joy. As soon as the tree had
      received them beneath its shade, they felt eased of all the anxious
      disquiet which had so long distressed them. The fears which had made them
      avoid each other, the fierce wrestling of spirit which had torn and
      wounded them, without consciousness on their part of what they were really
      contending against, vanished, and left them in perfect peace. Absolute
      confidence, supreme serenity, now pervaded them, they yielded
      unhesitatingly to the joy of being together in that lonely nook, so
      completely hidden from the outside world. They had surrendered themselves
      to the garden, they awaited in all calmness the behests of that tree of
      life. It enveloped them in such ecstasy of love that the whole clearing
      seemed to disappear from before their eyes, and to leave them wrapped in
      an atmosphere of perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The air is like ripe fruit,&rsquo; murmured Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Serge whispered in his turn: &lsquo;The grass seems so full of life and
      motion, that I could almost think I was treading on your dress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kind of religious feeling which made them lower their voices. No
      sentiment of curiosity impelled them to raise their heads and scan the
      tree. The consciousness of its majesty weighed heavily upon them. With a
      glance Albine asked whether she had overrated the enchantment of the
      greenery, and Serge answered her with two tears that trickled down his
      cheeks. The joy that filled them at being there could not be expressed in
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; she whispered in his ear, in a voice that was softer than a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she glided on in front of him, and seated herself at the very foot of
      the tree. Then, with a fond smile, she stretched out her hands to him;
      while he, standing before her, grasped them in his own with a responsive
      smile. Then she drew him slowly towards her and he sank down by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! do you remember,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that wall which seemed to have grown up
      between us? Now there is nothing to keep us apart&mdash;you are not
      unhappy now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;very happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they relapsed into silence whilst soft emotion stole over
      them. Then Serge, caressing Albine, exclaimed: &lsquo;Your face is mine; your
      eyes, your mouth, your cheeks are mine. Your arms are mine, from your
      shoulders to the tips of your nails. You are wholly mine.&rsquo; And as he spoke
      he kissed her lips, her eyes, her cheeks. He kissed her arms, with quick
      short kisses, from her fingers to her shoulders. He poured upon her a rain
      of kisses hot as a summer shower, deluging her cheeks, her forehead, her
      lips, and her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you are mine, I am yours,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;yours for ever; for I now
      well know that you are my queen, my sovereign, whom I must worship on
      bended knee. I am here only to obey you, to lie at your feet, to
      anticipate your wishes, to shelter you with my arms, to drive away
      whatever might trouble your tranquillity. And you are my life&rsquo;s goal.
      Since I first awoke in this garden, you have ever been before me; I have
      grown up that I might be yours. Ever, as my end, my reward, have I gazed
      upon your grace. You passed in the sunshine with the sheen of your golden
      hair; you were a promise that I should some day know all the mysteries and
      necessities of creation, of this earth, of these trees, these waters,
      these skies, whose last secret is yet unrevealed. I belong to you; I am
      your slave; I will listen to you and obey you, with my lips upon your
      feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this, bowed to the ground, adoring Woman. And Albine, full of
      pride, allowed herself to be adored. She yielded her hands, her cheeks,
      her lips, to Serge&rsquo;s rapturous kisses. She felt herself indeed a queen as
      she saw him, who was so strong, bending so humbly before her. She had
      conquered him, and held him there at her mercy. With a single word she
      could dispose of him. And that which helped her to recognise her
      omnipotence was that she heard the whole garden rejoicing at her triumph,
      with gradually swelling paeans of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! if we could fly off together, if we could but die even, in one
      another&rsquo;s arms,&rsquo; faltered Serge, scarce able to articulate. But Albine had
      strength enough to raise her finger as though to bid him listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the garden that had planned and willed it all. For weeks and weeks
      it had been favouring and encouraging their passion, and at last, on that
      supreme day, it had lured them to that spot, and now it became the Tempter
      whose every voice spoke of love. From the flower-beds, amid the fragrance
      of the languid blossoms, was wafted a soft sighing, which told of the
      weddings of the roses, the love-joys of the violets; and never before had
      the heliotropes sent forth so voluptuous a perfume. Mingled with the soft
      air which arose from the orchard were all the exhalations of ripe fruit,
      the vanilla of apricots, the musk of oranges, all the luscious aroma of
      fruitfulness. From the meadows came fuller notes, the million sighs of the
      sun-kissed grass, the multitudinous love-plaints of legions of living
      things, here and there softened by the refreshing caresses of the
      rivulets, on whose banks the very willows palpitated with desire. And the
      forest proclaimed the mighty passion of the oaks. Through the high
      branches sounded solemn music, organ strains like the nuptial marches of
      the ashes and the birches, the hornbeams and the planes, while from the
      bushes and the young coppices arose noisy mirth like that of youthful
      lovers chasing one another over banks and into hollows amid much crackling
      and snapping of branches. From afar, too, the faint breeze wafted the
      sounds of the rocks splitting in their passion beneath the burning heat,
      while near them the spiky plants loved in a tragic fashion of their own,
      unrefreshed by the neighbouring springs, which themselves glowed with the
      love of the passionate sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do they say?&rsquo; asked Serge, half swooning, as Albine pressed him to
      her bosom. The voices of the Paradou were growing yet more distinct. The
      animals, in their turn, joined in the universal song of nature. The
      grasshoppers grew faint with the passion of their chants; the butterflies
      scattered kisses with their beating wings. The amorous sparrows flew to
      their mates; the rivers rippled over the loves of the fishes; whilst in
      the depths of the forest the nightingales sent forth pearly, voluptuous
      notes, and the stags bellowed their love aloud. Reptiles and insects,
      every species of invisible life, every atom of matter, the earth itself
      joined in the great chorus. It was the chorus of love and of nature&mdash;the
      chorus of the whole wide world; and in the very sky the clouds were
      radiant with rapture, as to those two children Love revealed the Eternity
      of Life.

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Albine and Serge smiled at one another.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you, Albine,&rsquo; said Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge, I love you,&rsquo; Albine answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And never before had those syllables &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; had for them so supreme
      a meaning. They expressed everything. Joy pervaded those young lovers, who
      had attained to the fulness of life. They felt that they were now on a
      footing of equality with the forces of the world; and with their happiness
      mingled the placid conviction that they had obeyed the universal law. And
      Serge seemed to have awakened to life, lion-like, to rule the whole far
      expanse under the free heavens. His feet planted themselves more firmly on
      the ground, his chest expanded, there was pride and confidence in his gait
      and demeanour. He took Albine by the hands, she was trembling, and he was
      obliged to support her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you are she whom I love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Albine now who had become the submissive one. She drooped her head
      upon his shoulder, glancing up at him with anxious scrutiny. Would he
      never bear her spite for that hour of adoration in which he had called
      himself her slave? But he smiled, and stroked her hair, while she said to
      him: &lsquo;Let me stay like this, in your arms, for I cannot walk without you.
      I will make myself so small and light, that you will scarcely know I am
      there.&rsquo; Then becoming very serious she added, &lsquo;You must always love me;
      and I will be very obedient and do whatever you wish. I will yield to you
      in all things if you but love me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge felt more powerful and virile on seeing her so humble. &lsquo;Why are you
      trembling so?&rsquo; he asked her; &lsquo;I can have no cause to reproach you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not answer him, she gazed almost sadly upon the tree and the
      foliage and the grass around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Foolish child!&rsquo; he said, laughing; &lsquo;are you afraid that I shall be angry
      with you for your love? We have loved as we were meant to love. Let me
      kiss you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But, dropping her eyelids so that she might not see the tree, she said, in
      a low whisper, &lsquo;Take me away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge led her thence, pacing slowly and giving one last glance at the spot
      which love had hallowed. The shadows in the clearing were growing darker,
      and a gentle quiver coursed through the foliage. When they emerged from
      the wood and caught sight of the sun, still shining brightly in the
      horizon, they felt easier. Everything around Serge now seemed to bend down
      before him and pay homage to his love. The garden was now nothing but an
      appanage of Albine&rsquo;s beauty, and seemed to have grown larger and fairer
      amid the love-kisses of its rulers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine&rsquo;s joy was still tinged with disquietude. She would suddenly
      pause amid her laughter and listen anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; she replied, casting furtive glances behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not know in what out-of-the-way corner of the park they were. To
      lose themselves in their capricious wanderings only served to amuse them
      as a rule; but that day they experienced anxious embarrassment. By degrees
      they quickened their pace, plunging more and more deeply into a labyrinth
      of bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear?&rsquo; asked Albine, nervously, as she suddenly stopped short,
      almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge listened, a prey, in his turn, to the anxiety which the girl could
      no longer conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the coppice seems full of voices,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;It sounds as
      though there were people deriding us. Listen! Wasn&rsquo;t that a laugh that
      sounded from that tree? And over yonder did not the grass murmur something
      as my dress brushed against it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he said, anxious to reassure her, &lsquo;the garden loves us; and, if
      it said anything, it would not be to vex or annoy us. Don&rsquo;t you remember
      all the sweet words which sounded through the leaves? You are nervous and
      fancy things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head and faltered: &lsquo;I know very well that the garden is
      our friend.... So it must be some one who has broken into it. I am certain
      I hear some one. I am trembling all over. Oh! take me away and hide me
      somewhere, I beseech you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went on again, scanning every tree and bush, and imagining that
      they could see faces peering at them from behind every trunk. Albine was
      certain, she said, that there were steps pursuing them in the distance.
      &lsquo;Let us hide ourselves,&rsquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned quite scarlet. It was new-born modesty, a sense of shame
      which had laid hold of her like a fever, mantling over the snowy whiteness
      of her skin, which never previously had known that flush. Serge was
      alarmed at seeing her thus crimson, her face full of distress, her eyes
      brimming with tears. He tried to clasp her in his arms again and to soothe
      her with a caress; but she slipped away from him, and, with a despairing
      gesture, made sign that they were not alone. And her blushes grew deeper
      as her eyes fell upon her bare arms. She shuddered when her loose hanging
      hair stirred against her neck and shoulders. The slightest touch of a
      waving bough or a passing insect, the softest breath of air, now made her
      tremble as if some invisible hand were grasping at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calm yourself,&rsquo; begged Serge, &lsquo;there is no one. You are as crimson as
      though you had a fever. Let us rest here for a moment. Do; I beg you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no fever at all, she said, but she wanted to get back as quickly
      as possible, so that no one might laugh at her. And, ever increasing her
      pace, she plucked handfuls of leaves and tendrils from the hedges, which
      she entwined about her. She fastened a branch of mulberry over her hair,
      twisted bindweed round her arms, and tied it to her wrists, and circled
      her neck with such long sprays of laurustinus, that her bosom was hidden
      as by a veil of leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that shame of hers proved contagious. Serge, who first had jested,
      asking her if she were going to a ball, glanced at himself, and likewise
      felt alarmed and ashamed, to a point that he also wound foliage about his
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, they could discover no way out of the labyrinth of bushes, but
      all at once, at the end of the path, they found themselves face to face
      with an obstacle, a tall, grey, grave mass of stone. It was the wall of
      the Paradou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away! come away!&rsquo; cried Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she sought to drag him thence; but they had not taken another twenty
      steps before they again came upon the wall. They then skirted it at a ran,
      panic-stricken. It stretched along, gloomy and stern, without a break in
      its surface. But suddenly, at a point where it fringed a meadow, it seemed
      to fall away. A great breach gaped in it, like a huge window of light
      opening on to the neighbouring valley. It must have been the very hole
      that Albine had one day spoken of, which she said she had blocked up with
      brambles and stones. But the brambles now lay scattered around like
      severed bits of rope, the stones had been thrown some distance away, and
      the breach itself seemed to have been enlarged by some furious hand.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I felt sure of it,&rsquo; cried Albine, in accents of supreme despair. &lsquo;I
      begged you to take me away&mdash;Serge, I beseech you, don&rsquo;t look through
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge, in spite of himself, stood rooted to the ground, on the
      threshold of the breach through which he gazed. Down below, in the depths
      of the valley, the setting sun cast a sheet of gold upon the village of
      Les Artaud, which showed vision-like amidst the twilight in which the
      neighbouring fields were already steeped. One could plainly distinguish
      the houses that straggled along the high road; the little yards with their
      dunghills, and the narrow gardens planted with vegetables. Higher up, the
      tall cypress in the graveyard reared its dusky silhouette, and the red
      tiles on the church glowed brazier-like, the dark bell looking down on
      them like a human face, while the old parsonage at the side threw its
      doors and windows open to the evening air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; sobbed Albine, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t look out, Serge. Remember that
      you promised you would always love me. Ah! will you ever love me enough,
      now? Stay, let me cover your eyes with my hands. You know it was my hands
      that cured you. You won&rsquo;t push me away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he put her from him gently. Then, while she fell down and clung to his
      legs, he passed his hands across his face, as though he were wiping from
      his brow and eyes some last lingering traces of sleep. It was yonder,
      then, that lay the unknown world, the strange land of which he had never
      dreamed without vague fear. Where had he seen that country? From what
      dream was he awakening, that he felt such keen anguish swelling up in his
      breast till it almost choked him? The village was breaking out into life
      at the close of the day&rsquo;s work. The men were coming home from the fields
      with weary gait, their jackets thrown over their shoulders; the women,
      standing by their doors, were beckoning to them to hasten on; while the
      children, in noisy bands, chased the fowls about and pelted them with
      stones. In the churchyard a couple of scapegraces, a lad and a girl, were
      creeping along under the shelter of the wall in order to escape notice.
      Swarms of sparrows were retiring to roost beneath the eaves of the church;
      and, on the steps of the parsonage, a blue calico skirt had just appeared,
      of such spreading dimensions as to quite block the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he is looking out! he is looking out!&rsquo; sobbed Albine. &lsquo;Listen to me.
      It was only just now that you promised to obey me. I beg of you to turn
      round and to look upon the garden. Haven&rsquo;t you been very happy in the
      garden? It was the garden which gave me to you. Think of the happy days it
      has in store for us, what lasting bliss and enjoyment. Instead of which it
      will be death that will force its way through that hole, if you don&rsquo;t
      quickly flee and take me with you. See, all those people yonder will come
      and thrust themselves between us. We were so quite alone, so secluded, so
      well guarded by the trees! Oh! the garden is our love! Look on the garden,
      I beg it of you on my knees!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge was quivering. He had began to recollect. The past was
      re-awakening. He could distinctly hear the stir of the village life. Those
      peasants, those women and children, he knew them. There was the mayor,
      Bambousse, returning from Les Olivettes, calculating how much the
      approaching vintage would yield him; there were the Brichets, the husband
      crawling along, and the wife moaning with misery. There was Rosalie
      flirting with big Fortune behind a wall. He recognised also the pair in
      the churchyard, that mischievous Vincent and that bold hussy Catherine,
      who were catching big grasshoppers amongst the tombstones. Yes, and they
      had Voriau, the black dog, with them, helping them and ferreting about in
      the dry grass, and sniffing at every crack in the old stones. Under the
      eaves of the church the sparrows were twittering and bickering before
      going to roost. The boldest of them flew down and entered the church
      through the broken windows, and, as Serge followed them with his eyes, he
      recollected all the noise they had formerly made below the pulpit and on
      the step by the altar rails, where crumbs were always put for them. And
      that was La Teuse yonder, on the parsonage doorstep, looking fatter than
      ever in her blue calico dress. She was turning her head to smile at
      Desiree, who was coming up from the yard, laughing noisily. Then they both
      vanished indoors, and Serge, distracted with all these revived memories,
      stretched out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all over now,&rsquo; faltered Albine, as she sank down amongst the broken
      brambles. &lsquo;You will never love me enough again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept, while Serge stood rooted by the breach, straining his ears to
      catch the slightest sound that might be wafted from the village, waiting,
      as it were, for some voice that might fully awaken him. The bell in the
      church-tower had begun to sway, and slowly through the quiet evening air
      the three chimes of the <i>Angelus</i> floated up to the Paradou. It was a
      soft and silvery summons. The bell now seemed to be alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O God!&rsquo; cried Serge, falling on his knees, quite overcome by the emotion
      which the soft notes of the bell had excited in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down towards the ground, and he felt the three peals of the <i>Angelus</i>
      pass over his neck and echo through his heart. The voice of the bell
      seemed to grow louder. It was raised again sternly, pitilessly, for a few
      moments which seemed to him to be years. It summoned up before him all his
      old life, his pious childhood, his happy days at the seminary, and his
      first Masses in that burning valley of Les Artaud, where he had dreamt of
      a solitary, saintly life. He had always heard it speaking to him as it was
      doing now. He recognised every inflection of that sacred voice, which had
      so constantly fallen upon his ears, like the grave and gentle voice of a
      mother. Why had he so long ceased to hear it? In former times it had
      promised him the coming of Mary. Had Mary come then and taken him and
      carried him off into those happy green fastnesses, which the sound of the
      bell could not reach? He would never have lapsed into forgetfulness if the
      bell had not ceased to ring. And as he bent his head still lower towards
      the earth, the contact of his beard with his hands made him start. He
      could not recognise his own self with that long silky beard. He twisted it
      and fumbled about in his hair seeking for the bare circle of the tonsure,
      but a heavy growth of curls now covered his whole head from his brow to
      the nape of his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you were right,&rsquo; he said, casting a look of despair at Albine. &lsquo;It
      was forbidden. We have sinned, and we have merited some terrible
      punishment.... But I, indeed, I tried to reassure you, I did not hear the
      threats which sounded in your ears through the branches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine tried to clasp him in her arms again as she sobbed out, &lsquo;Get up,
      and let us escape together. Perhaps even yet there is time for us to love
      each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I haven&rsquo;t the strength. I should stumble and fall over the
      smallest pebble in the path. Listen to me. I am afraid of myself. I know
      not what man dwells in me. I have murdered myself, and my hands are red
      with blood. If you took me away, you would never see aught in my eyes save
      tears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed his wet eyes, as she answered passionately, &lsquo;No matter! Do you
      love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too terrified to answer her. A heavy step set the pebbles rolling
      on the other side of the wall. A growl of anger seemed to draw nigh.
      Albine had not been mistaken. Some one was, indeed, there, disturbing the
      woodland quiet with jealous inquisition. Then both Albine and Serge, as if
      overwhelmed with shame, sought to bide themselves behind a bush. But
      Brother Archangias, standing in front of the breach, could already see
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother remained for a moment silent, clenching his fists and looking
      at Albine clinging round Serge&rsquo;s neck, with the disgust of a man who has
      espied some filth by the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspected it,&rsquo; he mumbled between his teeth. &lsquo;It was virtually certain
      that they had hidden him here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a few steps, and cried out: &lsquo;I see you. It is an abomination.
      Are you a brute beast to go coursing through the woods with that female?
      She has led you far astray, has she not? She has besmeared you with filth,
      and now you are hairy like a goat.... Pluck a branch from the trees
      wherewith to smite her on the back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Albine whispered in an ardent, prayerful voice: &lsquo;Do you love me? Do
      you love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge, with bowed head, kept silence, though he did not yet drive her
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fortunately, I have found you,&rsquo; continued Brother Archangias. &lsquo;I
      discovered this hole.... You have disobeyed God, and have slain your own
      peace. Henceforward, for ever, temptation will gnaw you with its fiery
      tooth, and you will no longer have ignorance of evil to help you to fight
      it. It was that creature who tempted you to your fall, was it not? Do you
      not see the serpent&rsquo;s tail writhing amongst her hair? The mere sight of
      her shoulders is sufficient to make one vomit with disgust.... Leave her.
      Touch her not, for she is the beginning of hell. In the name of God, come
      forth from that garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you love me? Oh! do you love me?&rsquo; reiterated Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge hastily drew away from her as though her bare arms and shoulders
      really scorched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of God! In the name of God!&rsquo; cried the Brother, in a voice of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge unresistingly stepped towards the breach. As soon as Brother
      Archangias, with rough violence, had dragged him out of the Paradou,
      Albine, who had fallen half fainting to the ground, with hands wildly
      stretched towards the love which was deserting her, rose up again, choking
      with sobs. And she fled, vanished into the midst of the trees, whose
      trunks she lashed with her streaming hair.

      When Abbe Mouret had said the <i>Pater</i>, he bowed to the altar, and
      went to the Epistle side. Then he came down, and made the sign of the
      cross over big Fortune and Rosalie, who were kneeling, side by side,
      before the altar-rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et
      Spiritus Sancti</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Amen</i>,&rsquo; responded Vincent, who was serving the mass, and glancing
      curiously at his big brother out of the corner of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune and Rosalie bent their heads, affected by some slight emotion,
      although they had nudged each other with their elbows when they knelt
      down, by way of making one another laugh. But Vincent went to get the
      basin and the sprinkler. Fortune placed the ring in the basin, a thick
      ring of solid silver. When the priest had blessed it, sprinkling it
      crosswise, he returned it to Fortune, who slipped it upon Rosalie&rsquo;s
      finger. Her hand was still discoloured with grass-stains, which soap had
      not been able to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti</i>,&rsquo; Abbe Mouret
      murmured again, giving them a final benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Amen</i>,&rsquo; responded Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early morning. The sun was not yet shining through the big windows
      of the church. Outside one could hear the noisy twittering of the sparrows
      in the branches of the service tree, whose foliage shot through the broken
      panes. La Teuse, who had not previously had time to clean the church, was
      now dusting the altar, craning up on her sound leg to wipe the feet of the
      ochre and lake-bedaubed Christ, and arranging the chairs as quietly as
      possible; all the while bowing and crossing herself, and following the
      service, but not omitting a single sweep of her feather broom. Quite
      alone, at the foot of the pulpit, was mother Brichet, praying in a very
      demonstrative fashion. She kept on her knees, and repeated the prayers in
      so loud a whisper that it seemed as if a swarm of bluebottles had taken
      possession of the nave.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end of the church near the confessional, Catherine held an
      infant in swaddling clothes. As it began to cry, she turned her back upon
      the altar, and tossed it up, and amused it with the bell-rope, which
      dangled just over its nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Dominus vobiscum</i>,&rsquo; said the priest, turning round, and spreading
      out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Et cum spiritu tuo</i>,&rsquo; responded Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment three big girls came into the church. They were too shy to
      go far up, though they jostled one another to get a better view of what
      was going on. They were three friends of Rosalie, who had dropped in for a
      minute or two on their way to the fields, curious as they were to hear
      what his reverence would say to the bride and bridegroom. They had big
      scissors hanging at their waists. At last they hid themselves behind the
      font, where they pinched each other and twisted themselves about, while
      trying to choke their bursts of laughter with their clenched fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; whispered La Rousse, a finely built girl, with copper-coloured
      skin and hair, &lsquo;there won&rsquo;t be any scrimmage to get out of church when
      it&rsquo;s all over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! old Bambousse is quite right,&rsquo; murmured Lisa, a short dark girl, with
      gleaming eyes; &lsquo;when one has vines, one looks after them. Since his
      reverence so particularly desired to marry Rosalie, he can very well do it
      all alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other girl, Babet, who was humpbacked, tittered. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s mother
      Brichet,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;she is always here. She prays for the whole family.
      Listen, do you hear how she&rsquo;s buzzing? All that will mean something in her
      pocket. She knows very well what she is about, I can tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is playing the organ for them,&rsquo; retorted La Rousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this all three burst into a laugh. La Teuse, in the distance,
      threatened them with her broom. At the altar, Abbe Mouret was taking the
      sacrament. As he went from the Epistle side towards Vincent, so that the
      water of ablution might be poured upon his thumb and fore-finger, Lisa
      said more softly: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly over. He will begin to talk to them
      directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said La Rousse, &lsquo;and so big Fortune will still be able to go to his
      work, and Rosalie won&rsquo;t lose her day&rsquo;s pay at the vintage. It is very
      convenient to be married so early in the morning. He looks very sheepish,
      that big Fortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; murmured Babet. &lsquo;It tires him, keeping so long on his knees.
      You may be sure that he has never knelt so long since his first
      communion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girls&rsquo; attention was suddenly distracted by the baby which
      Catherine was dangling in her arms. It wanted to get hold of the
      bell-rope, and was quite blue with rage, frantically stretching out its
      little hands and almost choking itself with crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! so the youngster is there,&rsquo; said La Rousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby now burst into still louder wailing, and struggled like a little
      Imp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turn it over on its stomach, and let it suck,&rsquo; said Babet to Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine lifted up her head, and began to laugh, with the shamelessness
      of a little minx. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not at all amusing,&rsquo; she said, giving the baby a
      shake. &lsquo;Be quiet, will you, little pig! My sister plumped it down on my
      knees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Naturally,&rsquo; said Babet, mischievously. &lsquo;You could scarcely have expected
      her to give the brat to Monsieur le Cure to nurse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sally, La Rousse almost fell over in a fit of laughter. She leaned
      against the wall, holding her sides with her hands. Lisa threw herself
      against her, and attempted to soothe her by pinching her back and
      shoulders; while Babet laughed with a hunchback&rsquo;s laugh, which grated on
      the ear like the sound of a saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the little one,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;Monsieur le Cure
      would have lost all use for his holy water. Old Bambousse had made up his
      mind to marry Rosalie to young Laurent, of Figuieres.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the girls&rsquo; merriment and their chatter now came to an end, for
      they saw La Teuse limping furiously towards them. At this the three big
      hussies felt alarmed, stepped back, and subsided into sedateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You worthless things!&rsquo; hissed La Teuse. &lsquo;You come to talk a lot of filth
      here, do you? Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself, La Rousse? You ought to be
      there, on your knees, before the altar, like Rosalie. I will throw you
      outside if you stir again. Do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Rousse&rsquo;s copper cheeks were tinged with a rising blush, and Babet
      glanced at her and tittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you,&rsquo; continued La Teuse, turning towards Catherine, &lsquo;just you leave
      that baby alone. You are pinching it on purpose to make it scream. Don&rsquo;t
      tell me you are not. Give it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the child, hushed it in her arms for a moment, and then laid it
      upon a chair, where it went to sleep, peacefully like a cherub. The church
      then subsided into solemn quietness, disturbed only by the chattering of
      the sparrows on the rowan tree outside. At the altar, Vincent had carried
      the missal to the right again, and Abbe Mouret had just folded the
      corporal and slipped it within the burse. He was now saying the concluding
      prayers with a solemn earnestness, which neither the screams of the baby
      nor the giggling of the three girls had been able to disturb. He seemed to
      hear nothing of them, but to be wholly absorbed in the prayers which he
      was offering up to Heaven for the happiness of the pair whose union he had
      just blessed. The sky that morning was grey with a hazy heat, which veiled
      the sun. Through the broken windows a russet vapour streamed into the
      church, betokening a stormy day. Along the walls the gaudily coloured
      pictures of the Stations of the Cross displayed their red, blue, and
      yellow patches; at the bottom of the nave the dry woodwork of the gallery
      creaked and strained; and under the doorway the tall grass by the steps
      thrust ripening straw, all alive with little brown grasshoppers. The
      clock, in its wooden case, made a whirring noise, as though it were some
      consumptive trying to clear his throat, and then huskily struck half-past
      six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ite, missa est</i>,&rsquo; said the priest, turning round to the
      congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Deo gratias</i>,&rsquo; responded Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having kissed the altar, Abbe Mouret once more turned round, and
      murmured over the bent heads of the newly married pair the final
      benediction: &lsquo;<i>Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob vobiscum sit</i>&rsquo;&mdash;his
      voice dying away into a gentle whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, he&rsquo;s going to address them,&rsquo; said Babet to her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very pale,&rsquo; observed Lisa. &lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t a bit like Monsieur Caffin,
      whose fat face always seemed to be on the laugh. My little sister Rose
      says that she daren&rsquo;t tell him anything when she goes to confess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same,&rsquo; murmured La Rousse, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s not ugly. His illness has aged
      him a little, but it seems to suit him. He has bigger eyes, and lines at
      the corners of his mouth which make him look like a man. Before he had the
      fever, he was too much like a girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe he&rsquo;s got some great trouble,&rsquo; said Babet. &lsquo;He looks as though
      he were pining away. His face is deadly pale, but how his eyes glitter!
      When he drops his eyelids, it is just as though he were doing it to
      extinguish the fire in his eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse again shook her broom at them. &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; she hissed out, so
      energetically that it seemed as if a blast of wind had burst into the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Abbe Mouret had collected himself, and he began, in a rather low
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear brother, my dear sister, you are joined together in Jesus. The
      institution of marriage symbolises the sacred union between Jesus and His
      Church. It is a bond which nothing can break; which God wills shall be
      eternal, so that man may not sever those whom Heaven has joined. In making
      you flesh of each other&rsquo;s flesh, and bone of each other&rsquo;s bone, God
      teaches you that it is your duty to walk side by side through life, a
      faithful couple, along the paths which He, in His omnipotence, appoints
      for you. And you must love each other with God-like love. The slightest
      ill-feeling between you will be disobedience to the Creator, Who has
      joined you together as a single body. Remain, then, for ever united, after
      the likeness of the Church, which Jesus has espoused, in giving to us all
      His body and blood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Fortune and Rosalie sat listening, with their noses peaked up
      inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does he say?&rsquo; asked Lisa, who was a little deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he says what they all say,&rsquo; answered La Rousse. &lsquo;He has a glib
      tongue, like all the priests have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret went on with his address, his eyes wandering over the heads of
      the newly wedded couple towards a shadowy corner of the church. And by
      degrees his voice became more flexible, and he put emotion into the words
      he spoke, words which he had formerly learned by heart from a manual
      intended for the use of young priests. He had turned slightly towards
      Rosalie, and whenever his memory failed him, he added sentences of his
      own:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sister, submit yourself to your husband, as the Church submits
      itself to Jesus. Remember that you must leave everything to follow him,
      like a faithful handmaiden. You must give up father and mother, you must
      cleave only to your husband, and you must obey him that you may obey God
      also. And your yoke will be a yoke of love and peace. Be his comfort, his
      happiness, the perfume of his days of strength, the support of his days of
      weakness. Let him find you, as a grace, ever by his side. Let him have but
      to reach out his hand to find yours grasping it. It is thus that you will
      step along together, never losing your way, and that you will meet with
      happiness in the carrying out of the divine laws. Oh! my dear sister, my
      dear daughter, your humility will hear sweet fruit; it will give birth to
      all the domestic virtues, to the joys of the hearth, and the prosperity
      that attends a God-fearing family. Have for your husband the love of
      Rachel, the wisdom of Rebecca, the constant fidelity of Sarah. Tell
      yourself that a pure life is the source of all happiness. Pray to God each
      morning that He may give you strength to live as a woman who respects her
      responsibilities and duties; for the punishment you would otherwise incur
      is terrible: you would lose your love. Oh! to live loveless, to tear flesh
      from flesh, to belong no more to the one who is half of your very self, to
      live on in pain and agony, bereft of the one you have loved! In vain would
      you stretch out your arms to him; he would turn away from you. You would
      yearn for happiness, but you would find in your heart nothing but shame
      and bitterness. Hear me, my daughter, it is in your own conduct, in your
      obedience, in your purity, in your love, that God has established the
      strength of your union.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Abbe Mouret spoke these words, there was a burst of laughter at the
      other end of the church. The baby had just woke up on the chair where La
      Teuse had laid it. But it was no longer in a bad temper. Having kicked
      itself free of its swaddling clothes, it was laughing merrily, and shaking
      its rosy little feet in the air. It was the sight of these little feet
      that made it laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalie, who was beginning to find the priest&rsquo;s address rather tedious,
      turned her head to smile at the child. But, when she saw it kicking about
      on the chair, she grew alarmed, and cast an angry look at Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you can look at me as much as you like,&rsquo; said Catherine. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
      going to take it any more. It would only begin to cry again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she turned aside to ferret in an ant-hole at a corner of one of the
      stone flags under the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Caffin didn&rsquo;t talk so long,&rsquo; now remarked La Rousse. &lsquo;When he
      married Miette, he just gave her two taps on the cheek and told her to be
      good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear brother,&rsquo; resumed Abbe Mouret, turning towards big Fortune, &lsquo;it is
      God who, to-day, gives you a companion, for He does not wish that man
      should live alone. But, if He ordains that she shall be your servant, He
      demands from you that you shall be to her a master full of gentleness and
      love. You will love her, because she is part of your own flesh, of your
      own blood, and your own bone. You will protect her, because God has given
      you strong arms only that you may stretch them over her head in the hour
      of danger. Remember that she is entrusted to you, and that you cannot
      abuse her submission and weakness without sin. Oh! my dear brother, what
      proud happiness should be yours! Henceforth, you will no longer live in
      the selfish egotism of solitude. At all hours you will have a lovable duty
      before you. There is nothing better than to love, unless it be to protect
      those whom we love. Your heart will expand; your manly strength will
      increase a hundredfold. Oh! to be a support and stay, to have a love given
      into your keeping, to see a being sink her existence in yours and say,
      &ldquo;Take me and do with me what you will! I trust myself wholly to you!&rdquo; And
      may you be accursed if you ever abandon her! It would be a cowardly
      desertion which God would assuredly punish. From the moment she gives
      herself to you, she becomes yours for ever. Carry her rather in your arms,
      and set her not upon the ground until it be certain that she will be there
      in safety. Give up everything, my dear brother&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the Abbe&rsquo;s voice faltered, and only an indistinct murmur came
      from his lips. He had quite closed his eyes, his face was deathly white,
      and his voice betokened such deep distress that big Fortune himself shed
      tears without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t recovered yet,&rsquo; said Lisa. &lsquo;It is wrong of him to fatigue
      himself. See, there&rsquo;s Fortune crying!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men are softer-hearted than women,&rsquo; murmured Babet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He spoke very well, all the same,&rsquo; remarked La Rousse. &lsquo;Those priests
      think of a lot of things that wouldn&rsquo;t occur to anybody else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried La Teuse, who was already making ready to extinguish the
      candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abbe Mouret still stammered on, trying to utter a few more sentences.
      &lsquo;It is for this reason, my dear brother, my dear sister, that you must
      live in the Catholic Faith, which alone can ensure the peace of your
      hearth. Your families have taught you to love God, to pray to Him every
      morning and evening, to look only for the gifts of His mercy&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unable to finish. He turned round, took the chalice off the altar,
      and retired, with bowed head, into the vestry, preceded by Vincent, who
      almost let the cruets and napkin fall, in trying to see what Catherine
      might be doing at the end of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the heartless creature!&rsquo; said Rosalie, who left her husband to go and
      take her baby in her arms. The child laughed. She kissed it, and
      rearranged its swaddling clothes, while threatening Catherine with her
      fist. &lsquo;If it had fallen,&rsquo; she cried out, &lsquo;I would have boxed your ears for
      you, nicely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Fortune now came slouching along. The three girls stepped towards him,
      with compressed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See how proud he is,&rsquo; murmured Babet to the others. &lsquo;He is sure of
      inheriting old Bambousse&rsquo;s money now. I used to see him creeping along
      every night under the little wall with Rosalie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they giggled, and big Fortune, standing there in front of them,
      laughed even louder than they did. He pinched La Rousse, and let Lisa jeer
      at him. He was a sturdy young blood, and cared nothing for anybody. The
      priest&rsquo;s address had annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo! mother, come on!&rsquo; he called in his loud voice. But mother Brichet
      was begging at the vestry door. She stood there, tearful and wizen, before
      La Teuse, who was slipping some eggs into the pocket of her apron. Fortune
      didn&rsquo;t seem to feel the least sense of shame. He just winked and remarked:
      &lsquo;She is a knowing old card, my mother is. But then the Cure likes to see
      people at mass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Rosalie had grown calm again. Before leaving the church, she
      asked Fortune if he had begged the priest to come and bless their room,
      according to the custom of the country. So Fortune ran off to the vestry,
      striding heavily through the church, as if it were a field. He soon
      reappeared, shouting that his reverence would come. La Teuse, who was
      scandalised at the noise made by all these people, who seemed to think
      themselves in a public street, gently clapped her hands, and pushed them
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all over,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;go away and get to your work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought they had all gone, when her eye caught sight of Catherine,
      whom Vincent had joined. They were bending anxiously over the ants&rsquo; nest.
      Catherine was poking a long straw into the hole so roughly, that a swarm
      of frightened ants had rushed out upon the floor. Vincent declared,
      however, that she must get her straw right to the bottom if she wished to
      find the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you young imps!&rsquo; cried La Teuse, &lsquo;what are you after there? Can&rsquo;t you
      leave the poor little things alone? That is Mademoiselle Desiree&rsquo;s ants&rsquo; 
      nest. She would be nicely pleased if she saw you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the children promptly took to their heels.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, now wearing his cassock but still bareheaded, had come back
      to kneel at the foot of the altar. In the grey light that streamed through
      the window, his tonsure showed like a large livid spot amidst his hair;
      and a slight quiver, as if from cold, sped down his neck. With his hands
      tightly clasped he was praying earnestly, so absorbed in his devotions
      that he did not hear the heavy footsteps of La Teuse, who hovered around
      without daring to disturb him. She seemed to be grieved at seeing him
      bowed down there on his knees. For a moment, she thought that he was in
      tears, and thereupon she went behind the altar to watch him. Since his
      return, she had never liked to leave him in the church alone, for one
      evening she had found him lying in a dead faint upon the flagstones, with
      icy lips and clenched teeth, like a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, mademoiselle!&rsquo; she said to Desiree, who was peeping through the
      vestry-doorway. &lsquo;He is still here, and he will lay himself up. You know
      you are the only person that he will listen to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is breakfast-time,&rsquo; she replied softly, &lsquo;and I am very hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gently sidled up to the priest, passed an arm round his neck, and
      kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, brother,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Do you want to make me die of hunger
      this morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The face he turned upon her was so intensely sad, that she kissed him
      again on both his cheeks. He was emerging from agony. Then, on recognising
      her, he tried to put her from him, but she kept hold of one of his hands
      and would not release it. She would scarcely allow him to cross himself,
      but insisted upon leading him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! Come! for I am very hungry. You must be hungry too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse had laid out the breakfast beneath two big mulberry trees, whose
      spreading branches formed a sheltering roof at the bottom of the little
      garden. The sun, which had at last succeeded in dissipating the
      stormy-looking vapours of early morning, was warming the beds of
      vegetables, while the mulberry-trees cast a broad shadow over the rickety
      table, on which were laid two cups of milk and some thick slices of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see how nice it looks,&rsquo; said Desiree, delighted at breakfasting in
      the fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was already cutting some of the bread into strips, which she ate with
      eager appetite. And as she saw La Teuse still standing in front of them,
      she said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat something?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall, presently,&rsquo; the old servant answered. &lsquo;My soup is warming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, looking with admiration at the girl&rsquo;s big
      bites, she said to the priest: &lsquo;It is quite a pleasure to see her. Doesn&rsquo;t
      she make you feel hungry, Monsieur le Cure? You should force yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret smiled as he glanced at his sister. &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; he murmured;
      &lsquo;she gets on famously, she grows fatter every day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s because I eat,&rsquo; said Desiree. &lsquo;If you would eat you would get fat,
      too. Are you ill again? You look very melancholy. I don&rsquo;t want to have it
      all over again, you know. I was so very lonely when they took you away to
      cure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is right,&rsquo; said La Teuse. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t behave reasonably, Monsieur le
      Cure. You can&rsquo;t expect to be strong, living, as you do, on two or three
      crumbs a day, as though you were a bird. You don&rsquo;t make blood; and that&rsquo;s
      why you are so pale. Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed of keeping as thin as a lath
      when we are so fat; we who are only women? People will begin to think that
      we gobble up everything and leave you nothing but the empty plates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then both La Teuse and Desiree, brimful of health and strength, scolded
      him affectionately. His eyes seemed very large and bright, but empty,
      expressionless. He was still gently smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not ill,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I have nearly finished my milk.&rsquo; He had
      swallowed two mouthfuls of it, but had not touched the bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The animals, now,&rsquo; said Desiree, thoughtfully, &lsquo;seem to get on much more
      comfortably than we do. The fowls never have headaches, have they? The
      rabbits grow as fat as ever one wants them to be. And you never saw my pig
      looking sad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning towards her brother, she went on with an air of rapture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have named it Matthew, because it is so like that fat man who brings
      the letters. It is growing so big and strong. It is very unkind of you to
      refuse to come and look at it as you always do. You will come to see it
      some day, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus talking she had laid hold of her brother&rsquo;s share of
      bread, and was eating away at it. She had already finished one piece, and
      was beginning the second, when La Teuse became aware of what she was
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t belong to you, that bread! You are actually stealing his
      food from him now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let her have it,&rsquo; said Abbe Mouret, gently. &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have touched it
      myself. Eat it all, my dear, eat it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Desiree fell into confusion, with her eyes fixed upon the
      bread, whilst she struggled to check her rising tears. Then she began to
      laugh, and finished the slice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My cow,&rsquo; said she, continuing her remarks, &lsquo;is never as sad as you are.
      You were not here when uncle Pascal gave her to me, on the promise that I
      would be a good girl, or you would have seen how pleased she was when I
      kissed her for the first time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused to listen. A cock crowed in the yard, and a great uproar
      followed, with flapping of wings and cackling, grunting, and hoarse cries
      as if the whole yard were in a state of commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you know,&rsquo; resumed Desiree, clapping her hands, &lsquo;she must be in calf
      now. I took her to the bull at Beage, three leagues from here. There are
      very few bulls hereabouts, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse shrugged her shoulders, and glanced at the priest with an
      expression of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be much better, mademoiselle,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if you were to go and
      quiet your fowls. They all seem to be murdering one another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the uproar in the yard had now become so great that the girl was
      already hurrying off with a great rustling of her petticoats, when the
      priest called her back. &lsquo;The milk, my dear; you have not finished the
      milk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his cup to her, which he had scarcely touched. And she came
      back and drank the milk without the slightest scruple, in spite of La
      Teuse&rsquo;s angry look. Then she again set off for the poultry-yard, where
      they soon heard her reducing the fowls to peace and order. She had,
      perhaps, sat down in the midst of them, for she could be heard gently
      humming as though she were trying to lull them to sleep.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now my soup is too hot!&rsquo; grumbled La Teuse, as she returned from the
      kitchen with a basin, from which a wooden spoon was projecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed herself just in front of Abbe Mouret, and began to eat very
      cautiously from the edge of the spoon. She wanted to enliven the Abbe and
      to draw him out of his melancholy moodiness. Ever since he had returned
      from the Paradou, he had declared himself well again, and had never
      complained. Often, indeed, he smiled in so soft and sweet a fashion, that
      his fever seemed to have increased his saintliness, at least so thought
      the villagers. But, at intervals, he had fits of gloomy silence, and
      appeared to be suffering torture which he strove to bear uncomplainingly.
      It was a mute agony which bore down upon him, and, for hours at a time,
      left him stupefied, a prey to a frightful inward struggle, the violence of
      which could only be guessed by the sweat of anguish that streamed down his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such times La Teuse refused to leave him, and overwhelmed him with a
      torrent of gossip, until he had gradually recovered tranquillity by
      crushing the rebellion of his blood. On that particular morning, the old
      servant foresaw a more grievous attack than usual, and poured forth an
      amazing flood of talk, while continuing her wary manoeuvres with the
      spoon, which threatened to burn her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;one has to live among a lot of wild beasts to see
      such goings-on. Would any one ever think in a decent village of being
      married by candlelight? It shows what a poor sort these Artauds are. When
      I was in Normandy, I used to see weddings that threw every one into
      commotion for a couple of leagues round. They would feast for three whole
      days. The priest would be there, and the mayor, too; and at the marriage
      of one of my cousins, all the firemen came as well. And didn&rsquo;t they have a
      fine time of it! But to make a priest get up before sunrise and marry
      people before even the chickens have left their roost, why, there&rsquo;s no
      sense in it! If I had been your reverence, I should have refused to do it.
      You haven&rsquo;t had your proper sleep, and you may have caught cold in the
      church. It is that which has upset you. Besides which it would be better
      to marry brute beasts than that Rosalie and her ugly lout. That brat of
      theirs dirtied one of the chairs.&mdash;But you ought to tell me when you
      feel poorly, and I could make you something warm.&mdash;Eh! Monsieur le
      Cure, speak to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, in a feeble voice, that he was quite well, and only needed a
      little fresh air. He had just leant against one of the mulberry-trees, and
      was breathing rather quickly, as if faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! all right,&rsquo; went on La Teuse, &lsquo;do just as you like. Go on marrying
      people when you haven&rsquo;t the strength for it, and when you know very well
      that it&rsquo;s bound to upset you. I knew how it would be; I told you so
      yesterday. And if you took my advice, you wouldn&rsquo;t stay where you are. The
      smell of the yard is bad for you. It is frightful just now. I can&rsquo;t
      imagine what Mademoiselle Desiree can be stirring about there. She&rsquo;s
      singing away, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind it at all. Ah! that reminds me of
      something I want to tell you. You know that I did all I could to keep her
      from taking the cow to Beage; but she&rsquo;s like you, obstinate, and will go
      her own way. Fortunately, however, for her, she&rsquo;s none the worse for it.
      She delights to be amongst the animals and their young ones. But come now,
      your reverence, do be reasonable. Let me take you to your room. You must
      lie down and rest a little. What, you don&rsquo;t want to! Well, then, so much
      the worse for you, if you suffer! Besides, it&rsquo;s absurd to keep one&rsquo;s
      worries locked up in one&rsquo;s heart till they stifle one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in her indignation, she hastily swallowed a big spoonful of soup at
      the risk of burning her throat. She rattled the handle of the spoon
      against the bowl, muttering and grumbling to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There never was such a man,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;He would die rather than say a
      word. But it&rsquo;s all very well for him to keep silent. I know quite enough,
      and it doesn&rsquo;t require much cleverness to guess the rest. Well! well! let
      him keep it to himself. I dare say it is better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse was jealous. Dr. Pascal had had a tremendous fight with her in
      order to get her patient away at the time when he had come to the
      conclusion that the young priest&rsquo;s case would be quite hopeless if he
      should remain at the parsonage. He had then explained to her that the
      sound of the bell would aggravate and intensify Serge&rsquo;s fever, that the
      religious pictures and statuettes scattered about his room would fill his
      brain with hallucinations, and that entirely new surroundings were
      necessary if he was to be restored to health and strength and peacefulness
      of mind. She, however, had vigorously shaken her head, and declared that
      her &lsquo;dear child&rsquo; would nowhere find a better nurse than herself. Still,
      she had ended by yielding. She had even resigned herself to seeing him go
      to the Paradou, though protesting against this selection of the doctor&rsquo;s,
      which astonished her. But she retained a strong feeling of hatred for the
      Paradou; and she was hurt by the silence which Abbe Mouret maintained as
      to the time he had spent there. She had frequently laid all sorts of
      unsuccessful traps to induce him to talk of it. That morning, exasperated
      by his ghastly pallor, and his obstinacy in suffering in silence, she
      ended by waving her spoon about and crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should go back yonder again, Monsieur le Cure, if you were so happy
      there&mdash;I dare say there is some one there who would nurse you better
      than I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time she had ventured upon a direct allusion to her
      suspicions. The blow was so painful to the priest that he could not check
      a slight cry, as he raised his grief-racked countenance. At this La
      Teuse&rsquo;s kindly heart was filled with regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;it is all the fault of your uncle Pascal. I told him
      what it would be. But those clever men cling so obstinately to their own
      ideas. Some of them would kill you, just for the sake of rummaging in your
      body afterwards&mdash;It made me so angry that I would never speak of it
      to any one. Yes, Monsieur le Cure, you have me to thank that nobody knew
      where you were; I was so angry about it. I thought it abominable! When
      Abbe Guyot, from Saint-Eutrope, who took your place during your absence,
      came to say mass here on Sundays, I told him all sorts of stories. I said
      you had gone to Switzerland. I don&rsquo;t even know where Switzerland is.&mdash;Well!
      well! I surely don&rsquo;t want to say anything to pain you, but it was
      certainly over yonder that you got your trouble. Very finely they&rsquo;ve cured
      you indeed! It would have been very much better if they had left you with
      me. I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of trying to turn your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, whose brow was again lowered, made no attempt to interrupt
      her. La Teuse had seated herself upon the ground a few yards away from
      him, in order if possible to catch his eye. And she went on again in her
      motherly way, delighted at his seeming complacency in listening to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would never let me tell you about Abbe Caffin. As soon as I began to
      speak of him, you always made me stop. Well, well; Abbe Caffin had had his
      troubles in my part of the world, at Canteleu. And yet he was a very holy
      man, with an irreproachable character. But, you see, he was a man of very
      delicate taste, and liked soft pretty things. Well, there was a young
      party who was always prowling round him, the daughter of a miller, whom
      her parents had sent to a boarding-school. Well, to put it shortly, what
      was likely to happen did happen. When the story got about, all the
      neighbourhood was very indignant with the Abbe. But he managed to escape
      to Rouen, and poured out his grief to the Archbishop there. Then he was
      sent here. The poor man was punished quite enough by being made to live in
      this hole of a place. I heard of the girl afterwards. She had married a
      cattle-dealer, and was very happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse, delighted at having been allowed to tell her story, interpreted
      the priest&rsquo;s silence as an encouragement to continue her gossiping. So she
      drew a little nearer to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was very friendly with me, was good Monsieur Caffin, and often spoke
      to me of his sin. It won&rsquo;t keep him out of heaven, I&rsquo;m sure. He can rest
      quite peacefully out there under the turf, for he never harmed any one.
      For my part, I can&rsquo;t understand why people should get so angry with a
      priest when such a thing unhappily befalls him. Of course it&rsquo;s wrong, and
      likely to anger God; but then one can confess and repent, and get
      absolution. Isn&rsquo;t it so, your reverence, that when one truly repents, one
      is saved in spite of one&rsquo;s sins?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret slowly raised his head. By a supreme effort he had overcome
      his agony, and though his face was still very pale, he exclaimed in a firm
      voice, &lsquo;One should never sin; never! never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! sir,&rsquo; cried the old servant, &lsquo;you are too proud and reserved. It is
      not a nice thing, that pride of yours.&mdash;If I were in your place, I
      would not harden myself like that. I would talk of what was troubling me,
      and not try to rend my heart in pieces. You should reconcile yourself to
      the separation gradually. The worry wears off little by little. But,
      instead of that, you won&rsquo;t even allow people&rsquo;s names to be uttered. You
      forbid them to be mentioned. It is as though they were dead. Since you
      came back, I have not dared to tell you the least bit of news. Well, well,
      I am going to speak now, and I shall tell you all I know; because I see
      quite well that it is all this silence that is preying upon your heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her sternly, and lifted his finger to silence her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;I get news from over yonder, very often indeed,
      and I am going to tell it to you. To begin with, there is some one there
      who is no happier than you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence! Silence!&rsquo; said Abbe Mouret, summoning all his strength to rise
      and move away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But La Teuse also rose and barred his way with her bulky figure. She was
      angry, and cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, you see, you want to be off already! But you are going to listen
      to me. You know quite well that I am not over fond of the people yonder,
      don&rsquo;t you? If I talk to you about them, it is for your own good. Some
      people say that I am jealous. Well, one day I mean to take you over there.
      You would be with me, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of any harm happening.
      Will you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He motioned her away from him with his hands, and his face was calm again
      as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I desire nothing. I wish to know nothing. There is high mass to-morrow.
      You must see that the altar is made ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he walked away, he added, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy, my good Teuse. I am stronger than you imagine. I shall
      be able to cure myself without any one&rsquo;s assistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he went off, bearing himself sturdily, with his head
      erect, for he had vanquished his feelings. His cassock rustled very gently
      against the borders of thyme. La Teuse, who for a moment had remained
      rooted to the spot where she was standing, sulkily picked up her basin and
      wooden spoon. Then, shrugging her big shoulders again and again, she
      mumbled between her teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all bravado of his. He imagines that he is differently made from
      other men, just because he is a priest. Well, as a matter of fact, he is
      very firm and determined. I have known some who wouldn&rsquo;t have had to be
      wheedled so long. And he is quite capable of crushing his heart, just as
      one might crush a flea. It must be the Almighty who gives him his
      strength.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she returned to the kitchen she saw Abbe Mouret standing by the gate of
      the farmyard. Desiree had stopped him there to make him feel a capon which
      she had been fattening for some weeks past. He told her pleasantly that it
      was very heavy, and the big child chuckled with glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! well,&rsquo; said La Teuse in a fury, &lsquo;that bird has got to crush its heart
      too. But then it can&rsquo;t help itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret spent his days at the parsonage. He shunned the long walks
      which he had been wont to take before his illness. The scorched soil of
      Les Artaud, the ardent heat of that valley where the vines could never
      even grow straight, distressed him. On two occasions, in the morning, he
      had attempted to go out and read his breviary as he strolled along the
      road; but he had not gone beyond the village. He had returned home,
      overcome by the perfumes, the heat, the breadth of the landscape. It was
      only in the evening, in the cool twilight air, that he ventured to saunter
      a little in front of the church, on the terrace which led to the
      graveyard. In the afternoons, to fill up his time, and satisfy his craving
      for some kind of occupation, he had imposed upon himself the task of
      pasting paper over the broken panes of the church windows, This had kept
      him for a week mounted on a ladder, arranging his paper panes with great
      exactness, and laying on the paste with the most scrupulous care in order
      to avoid any mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse stood at the foot of the ladder and watched him. And Desiree
      urged that he must not fill up all the windows, or else the sparrows would
      no longer be able to get through. To please her, the priest left a pane or
      two in each window unfilled. Then, having completed these repairs, he was
      seized with the ambition of decorating the church, without summoning to
      his aid either mason or carpenter or painter. He would do it all himself.
      This sort of handiwork would amuse him, he said, and help to bring back
      his strength. Uncle Pascal encouraged him every time he called at the
      parsonage, assuring him that such exercise and fatigue were better than
      all the drugs in the world. And so Abbe Mouret began to stop up the holes
      in the walls with plaster, to drive fresh nails into the disjoined altars,
      and to crush and mix paints, in order that he might put a new coating on
      the pulpit and confessional-box. It was quite an event in the district,
      and folks talked of it for a couple of leagues round. Peasants would come
      and stand gazing, with their hands behind their backs, at his reverence&rsquo;s
      work. The Abbe himself, with a blue apron tied round his waist, and his
      hands all soiled with his labour, became absorbed in it, and used it as an
      excuse for no longer going out. He spent his days in the midst of his
      repairs, and was more tranquil than he had been before; almost cheerful,
      indeed, as he forgot the outer world, the trees and the sunshine and the
      warm breezes, which had formerly disturbed him so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur le Cure is free to do as he pleases, since the parish hasn&rsquo;t got
      to find the money,&rsquo; said old Bambousse, who came round every evening to
      see how the work was progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret spent all his savings on it. Some of his decorations, indeed,
      were so awkward that they would have excited many people&rsquo;s smiles. The
      replastering of the stonework soon tired him: so he contented himself with
      patching up the church walls all round to a height of some six feet from
      the ground. La Teuse mixed the plaster. When she talked of repairing the
      parsonage as well, for she was continually fearing that it would topple
      down on their heads, he told her that he did not think he could manage it,
      that a regular workman would be necessary; a reply which led to a terrible
      quarrel between them. La Teuse said it was quite ridiculous to go on
      ornamenting the church, where nobody slept, while their bedrooms were in
      such a crazy condition, for she was quite sure they would all be found,
      one morning, crushed to death by the fallen ceilings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall end by bringing my bed here, and placing it behind the altar,&rsquo; 
      she grumbled. &lsquo;I feel quite terrified sometimes at night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when the plaster was all used up, she said no more about
      repairing the parsonage. The painting which the priest executed quite
      delighted her. It was the chief charm of the improvements. The Abbe, who
      had repaired the woodwork everywhere with bits of boards, took particular
      pleasure in spreading his big brush, dipped in bright yellow paint, over
      all this woodwork. The gentle, up-and-down motion of the brush lulled him,
      left him thoughtless for hours whilst he gazed on the oily streaks of
      paint. When everything was quite yellow, the pulpit, the confessional-box,
      the altar rails, even the clock-case itself, he ventured to try his hand
      at imitation marble work by way of touching up the high altar. Then,
      growing bolder, he painted it all over. Glistening with white and yellow
      and blue, it was pronounced superb. People who had not been to mass for
      fifty years streamed into the church to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the paint was dry. All that remained for Abbe Mouret to do was to
      edge the panels with brown beading. So, that afternoon, he set to work at
      it, wishing to get it done by evening; for on the following day, as he had
      reminded La Teuse, there would be high mass. She was there ready to
      arrange the altar. She had already placed on the credence the candlesticks
      and the silver cross, the porcelain vases filled with artificial roses,
      and the laced cloth which was only used on great festivals. The beading,
      however, proved so difficult of execution, that it was not completed till
      late in the evening. It was growing quite dark as the Abbe finished his
      last panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be really too beautiful,&rsquo; said a rough voice from amidst the
      greyish gloom of twilight which was filling the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse, who had knelt down to get a better view of the Abbe&rsquo;s brush as
      it glided along his rule, started with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s Brother Archangias,&rsquo; she said, turning round. &lsquo;You came in by
      the sacristy then? You gave me quite a turn. Your voice seemed to sound
      from under the floor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret had resumed his work, after greeting the Brother with a slight
      nod. The Brother remained standing there in silence, with his fat hands
      clasped in front of his cassock. Then, shrugging his shoulders, as he
      observed with what scrupulous care the priest sought to make his beading
      perfectly straight, he repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be really too beautiful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse, who knelt near by in ecstasy, started again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I had quite forgotten you were there. You really
      ought to cough before you speak. You have a voice that comes on one so
      suddenly that one might think it was a voice from the grave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose up and drew back a little the better to admire the Abbe&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why too beautiful?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Nothing can be too beautiful when it is
      done for the Almighty. If his reverence had only had some gold, he would
      have done it with gold, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the priest had finished, she hastened to change the altar-cloth,
      taking the greatest care not to smudge the beading. Then she arranged the
      cross, the candlesticks, and the vases symmetrically. Abbe Mouret had gone
      to lean against the wooden screen which separated the choir from the nave,
      by the side of Brother Archangias. Not a word passed between them. Their
      eyes were fixed upon the silver crucifix, which, in the increasing gloom,
      still cast some glimmer of light on the feet and the left side and the
      right temple of the big Christ. When La Teuse had finished, she came down
      towards them, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look lovely?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Just you see what a crowd there will
      be at mass to-morrow! Those heathens will only come to God&rsquo;s house when
      they think He is well-to-do. Now, Monsieur le Cure, we must do as much for
      the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s altar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Waste of money!&rsquo; growled Brother Archangias.
    </p>
    <p>
      But La Teuse flew into a tantrum; and, as Abbe Mouret remained silent, she
      led them both before the altar of the Virgin, pushing them and dragging
      them by their cassocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just look at it,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;it is too shabby for anything, now that the
      high altar is so smart. It looks as though it had never been painted at
      all. However much I may rub it of a morning, the dust sticks to it. It is
      quite black; it is filthy. Do you know what people will say about you,
      your reverence? They will say that you care nothing for the Blessed
      Virgin; that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what of it?&rsquo; queried Brother Archangias.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse looked at him, half suffocated by indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of it? It would be sinful, of course,&rsquo; she muttered. &lsquo;This altar is
      like a neglected tomb in a graveyard. If it were not for me, the spiders
      would spin their webs across it, and moss would soon grow over it. From
      time to time, when I can spare a bunch of flowers, I give it to the
      Virgin. All the flowers in our garden used to be for her once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had mounted the altar steps, and she took up two withered bunches of
      flowers, which had been left there, forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See! it is just as it is in the graveyards,&rsquo; she said, throwing the
      flowers at Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked them up, without replying. It was quite dark now, and Brother
      Archangias stumbled about amongst the chairs and nearly fell. He growled
      and muttered some angry words, in which the names of Jesus and Mary
      recurred. When La Teuse, who had gone for a lamp, returned into the
      church, she asked the priest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I can put the brushes and pots away in the attic, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I have finished. We will see about the rest later
      on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked away in front of them, carrying all the things with her, and
      keeping silence, lest she should say too much. And as Abbe Mouret had kept
      the withered bunches of flowers in his hand, Brother Archangias said to
      him, as they passed the farmyard: &lsquo;Throw those things away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe took a few steps more, with downcast head; and then over the
      palings he flung the flowers upon a manure-heap.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Brother, who had already had his own meal, seated himself astride a
      chair, while the priest dined. Since Serge&rsquo;s return to Les Artaud, the
      Brother had thus spent most of his evenings at the parsonage; but never
      before had he imposed his presence upon the other in so rough a fashion.
      He stamped on the tiled floor with his heavy boots, his voice thundered
      and he smote the furniture, whilst he related how he had whipped some of
      his pupils that morning, or expounded his moral principles in terms as
      stern, as uncompromising as bludgeon-blows. Then feeling bored, he
      suggested that he and La Teuse should have a game at cards. They had
      endless bouts of &lsquo;Beggar-my-neighbour&rsquo; together, that being the only game
      which La Teuse had ever been able to learn. Abbe Mouret would smilingly
      glance at the first few cards flung on the table and would then gradually
      sink into reverie, remaining for hours forgetful of his self-restraint,
      oblivious of his surroundings, beneath the suspicious glances of Brother
      Archangias.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening La Teuse felt so cross that she had talked of going to bed as
      soon as the cloth was removed. The Brother, however, wanted his game of
      cards. So he caught hold of her shoulders and sat her down, so roughly
      that the chair creaked beneath her. And forthwith he began to shuffle the
      cards. Desiree, who hated him, had gone off carrying her dessert, which
      she generally took upstairs with her every evening to eat in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want the red cards,&rsquo; said La Teuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the struggle began. The old woman at first won some of the Brother&rsquo;s
      best cards. But before long two aces fell together on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a battle!&rsquo; she cried, wild with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw down a nine, which rather alarmed her, but as the Brother, in
      his turn, only put down a seven, she picked up the cards with a triumphant
      air. At the end of half an hour, however, she had only gained two aces, so
      that the chances remained fairly equal. And a quarter of an hour later she
      lost an ace. The knaves and kings and queens were perpetually coming and
      going as the battle furiously progressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid game, eh?&rsquo; said Brother Archangias, turning towards Abbe
      Mouret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he saw him sitting there, so absorbed in his reverie, with such a
      gentle smile playing unconsciously round his lips, he roughly raised his
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Monsieur le Cure, you are not paying any attention to us! It isn&rsquo;t
      polite of you. We are only playing on your account. We were trying to
      amuse you. Come and watch the game. It would do you more good than dozing
      and dreaming away there. Where were you just now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest started. He said nothing, but with quivering eyelids tried to
      force himself to look at the game. The play went on vigorously. La Teuse
      won her ace back, and then lost it again. On some evenings they would
      fight in this way over the aces for quite four hours, and often they would
      go off to bed, angry at having failed to bring the contest to a decisive
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, dear me! I&rsquo;ve only just remembered it!&rsquo; suddenly cried La Teuse, who
      greatly feared that she was going to be beaten. &lsquo;His reverence has to go
      out to-night. He promised Fortune and Rosalie that he would go to bless
      their room, according to the custom. Make haste, Monsieur le Cure! The
      Brother will go with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret had already risen from his chair, and was looking for his hat.
      But Brother Archangias, still holding his cards, flew into a tantrum: &lsquo;Oh!
      don&rsquo;t bother about it,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;What does it want to be blessed for that
      pigsty of theirs? It is a custom that you should do away with. I can&rsquo;t see
      any sense in it. Stay here and let us finish the game. That is much the
      best thing to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;I promised to go. Those good people might feel
      hurt if I didn&rsquo;t. You stay here and play your game out while you are
      waiting for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse glanced uneasily at Brother Archangias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, yes, I will stay here,&rsquo; cried the Brother. &lsquo;It is really too
      absurd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Abbe Mouret could open the door, he flung his cards on the
      table and rose to follow him. Then half turning back he called to La
      Teuse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have won. Leave the cards as they are, and we will play the game
      out to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! they are all mixed now,&rsquo; answered the old servant, who had lost no
      time in shuffling them together. &lsquo;Did you suppose that I was going to put
      your hand away under a glass case? And, besides, I might very well have
      won, for I still had an ace left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A few strides brought Brother Archangias up with Abbe Mouret, who was
      walking down the narrow path that led to the village. The Brother had
      undertaken the task of keeping watch over the Abbe&rsquo;s movements. He
      incessantly played the spy upon him, accompanying him everywhere, or, if
      he could not go in person, sending some school urchin to follow him. With
      that terrible laugh of his, he was wont to remark that he was &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
      gendarme.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in truth, the Abbe seemed like a culprit ever guarded by the black
      shadow of the Brother&rsquo;s cassock; a culprit to be treated distrustfully,
      since in his weakness he might well lapse into fresh crime were he left
      free from surveillance for a single moment. Thus he was watched and
      guarded with all the spiteful eagerness that some jealous old maid might
      have displayed, the overreaching zeal of a gaoler who might carry
      precautions so far as to exclude even such rays of light as might creep
      through the chinks of the prison-house. Brother Archangias was always on
      the watch to keep out the sunlight, to prevent even a whiff of air from
      entering, to shut up his prison so completely that nothing from outside
      could gain access to it. He noted the Abbe&rsquo;s slightest fits of weakness,
      and by his glance divined his tender thoughts, which with a word he
      pitilessly crushed, as though they were poisonous vermin. The priest&rsquo;s
      intervals of silence, his smiles, the paling of his brow, the faint
      quivering of his limbs, were all noted by the Brother. But he never spoke
      openly of the transgression. His presence alone was a sufficient reproach.
      The manner in which he uttered certain words imparted to them all the
      sting of a whip stroke. With a mere gesture he expressed his utter disgust
      for the priest&rsquo;s sin. Like one of those betrayed husbands who enjoy
      torturing their wives with cruel allusions, he contented himself with
      recalling the scene at the Paradou, in an indirect fashion, by some word
      or phrase which sufficed to annihilate the Abbe, whenever the latter&rsquo;s
      flesh rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock and most of the villagers of Les Artaud had
      retired to rest. But from a brightly lighted house at the far end, near
      the mill, there still came sounds of merriment. While keeping the best
      rooms for his own use, old Bambousse had given a corner of his house to
      his daughter and son-in-law. They were all assembled there, drinking a
      last glass, while waiting for the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are drunk,&rsquo; growled Brother Archangias. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the row they
      are making?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret made no reply. It was a lovely night and all looked bluish in
      the moonlight, which lent to the distant part of the valley the aspect of
      a sleeping lake. The priest slackened his pace that he might the more
      fully enjoy the charm of that soft radiance, and now and then he even
      stopped as he came upon some expanse of light, experiencing the delightful
      quiver which the proximity of fresh water brings one on a hot day. But the
      Brother continued striding along, grumbling and calling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along; come along! It isn&rsquo;t good to loiter out of doors at this time
      of night. You would be much better in bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, however, just as they were entering the village, Archangias
      himself stopped short in the middle of the road. He was looking towards
      the heights, where the white lines of the roads vanished amidst black
      patches of pine-woods, and he growled to himself, like a dog that scents
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can be coming down so late?&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the priest, who neither saw nor heard anything, was now, in his turn,
      anxious to press on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay! stay! there he is,&rsquo; eagerly added Brother Archangias. &lsquo;He has just
      turned the corner. See! he is in the moonlight now. One can see him
      plainly. It is a tall man, with a stick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he resumed, in a voice husky with fury:
      &lsquo;It is he, that beggar! I felt sure it was!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, the new-comer having now reached the bottom of the hill, Abbe
      Mouret saw that it was Jeanbernat. In spite of his eighty years, the old
      man set his feet down with such force, that his heavy, nailed boots sent
      sparks flying from the flints on the road. And he walked along as upright
      as an oak, without the aid of his stick, which he carried across his
      shoulder like a musket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! the villain!&rsquo; stammered the Brother, still standing motionless. &lsquo;May
      the fiend light all the blazes of hell under his feet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, who felt greatly disturbed, and despaired of inducing his
      companion to come on, turned round to continue his journey, hoping that,
      by a quick walk to the Bambousses&rsquo; house, he might yet manage to avoid
      Jeanbernat. But he had not taken five strides before he heard the
      bantering voice of the old man close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hie! Cure! wait for me. Are you afraid of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Abbe Mouret stopped, he came up and continued: &lsquo;Ah! those cassocks
      of yours are tiresome things, aren&rsquo;t they? They prevent your getting along
      too quickly. It&rsquo;s such a fine clear night, too, that one can recognise you
      by your gown a long way off. When I was right at the top of the hill, I
      said to myself, &ldquo;Surely that is the little priest down yonder.&rdquo; Oh! yes, I
      still have very good eyes.... Well, so you never come to see us now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had so much to do,&rsquo; murmured the priest, who had turned very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, every one&rsquo;s free to please himself. If I&rsquo;ve mentioned the
      matter, it&rsquo;s only because I want you to know that I don&rsquo;t bear you any
      grudge for being a priest. We wouldn&rsquo;t even talk about your religion, it&rsquo;s
      all one and the same to me. But the little one thinks that it&rsquo;s I who
      prevents your coming. I said to her, &ldquo;The priest is an idiot,&rdquo; and I think
      so, indeed. Did I try to eat you during your illness? Why, I didn&rsquo;t even
      go upstairs to see you. Every one&rsquo;s free, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke on in the most unconcerned manner, pretending that he did not
      notice the presence of Brother Archangias; but as the latter suddenly
      broke into an angry grunt, he added, &lsquo;Why, Cure, so you bring your pig out
      with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, you bandit!&rsquo; hissed the Brother, clenching his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanbernat, whose stick was still raised, then pretended to recognise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hands off!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, you soul-saver! I ought to have
      known you by your smell. We have a little account to settle together,
      remember. I have sworn to cut off your ears in the middle of your school.
      It will amuse the children you are poisoning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother fell back before the raised staff, a flood of abuse rising to
      his lips; but he began to stammer and went on disjointedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will set the gendarmes after you, scoundrel! You spat on the church; I
      saw you. You give the plague to the poor people who merely pass your door.
      At Saint-Eutrope you made a girl die by forcing her to chew a consecrated
      wafer which you had stolen. At Beage you went and dug up the bodies of
      little dead children and carried them away on your back. You are an old
      sorcerer! Everybody knows it, you scoundrel! You are the disgrace of the
      district. Whoever strangles you will gain heaven for the deed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man listened with a sneer, twirling the while his staff between
      his fingers. And between the Brother&rsquo;s successive insults he ejaculated in
      an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, go on; relieve yourself, you viper. I&rsquo;ll break your back for you
      by-and-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret tried to interfere, but Brother Archangias pushed him away,
      exclaiming: &lsquo;You are led by him yourself! Didn&rsquo;t he make you trample upon
      the cross? Deny it, if you dare!&rsquo; Then again, turning to Jeanbernat, he
      yelled: &lsquo;Ah! Satan, you must have chuckled and no mistake when you held a
      priest in your grasp! May Heaven curse those who abetted you in that
      sacrilege! What was it you did, at night, while he slept? You came and
      moistened his tonsure with your saliva, eh? so that his hair might grow
      more quickly. And then you breathed upon his chin and his cheeks that his
      beard might grow a hand&rsquo;s breadth in a single night. And you rubbed all
      your philters into his body, and breathed into his mouth the
      lasciviousness of a dog. You turned him into a brute-beast, Satan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s idiotic,&rsquo; said Jeanbernat, resting his stick on his shoulder. &lsquo;He
      quite bores me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother, however, growing bolder, thrust his fists under the old man&rsquo;s
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that drab of yours!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t deny that you set her on to
      damn the priest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly sprang backwards, with a shriek, for the old man,
      swinging his stick with all his strength, had just broken it over his
      back. Retreating yet a little further, Archangias picked from a heap of
      stones beside the road a piece of flint twice the size of a man&rsquo;s fist,
      and threw it at Jeanbernat. It would surely have split the other&rsquo;s
      forehead open if he had not bent down. He, however, now likewise crossed
      over to a heap of stones, sheltered himself behind it, and provided
      himself with missiles; and from one heap to the other a terrible combat
      began, with a perfect hail of flints. The moon now shone very brightly,
      and their dark shadows fell distinctly on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, you set that hussy on to ruin him!&rsquo; repeated the Brother, wild
      with rage. &lsquo;Ah! you are astonished that I know all about it! You hope for
      some monstrous result from it all. Every morning you make the thirteen
      signs of hell over that minx of yours! You would like her to become the
      mother of Antichrist. You long for Antichrist, you villain! But may this
      stone blind you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And may this one bung your mouth up!&rsquo; retorted Jeanbernat, who was now
      quite calm again. &lsquo;Is he cracked, the silly fellow, with all those stories
      of his?... Shall I have to break your head for you, before I can get on my
      way? Is it your catechism that has turned your brain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catechism, indeed! Do you know what catechism is taught to accursed ones
      like you? Ah! I will show you how to make the sign of the cross.&mdash;This
      stone is for the Father, and this for the Son, and this for the Holy
      Ghost. Ah! you are still standing. Wait a bit, wait a bit. Amen!&rsquo; Then he
      threw a handful of small pebbles like a volley of grape-shot. Jeanbernat,
      who was struck upon the shoulder, dropped the stones he was holding, and
      quietly stepped forwards, while Brother Archangias picked two fresh
      handfuls from the heap, blurting out:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to exterminate you. It is God who wills it. God is acting
      through my arm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you be quiet!&rsquo; said the old man, grasping him by the nape of the
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a short struggle amidst the dust of the road, all bluish with
      moonlight. The Brother, finding himself the weaker of the two, tried to
      bite. But Jeanbernat&rsquo;s sinewy limbs were like coils of rope which pinioned
      him so tightly that he could almost feel them cutting into his flesh. He
      panted and ceased to struggle, meditating some act of treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, having got the other under him, scoffingly exclaimed: &lsquo;I have
      a good mind to break one of your arms. You see that it isn&rsquo;t you who are
      the stronger, but that it is I who am exterminating you.... Now I&rsquo;m going
      to cut your ears off. You have tried my endurance too far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanbernat calmly drew his knife from his pocket. But Abbe Mouret, who had
      several times attempted to part the combatants, now raised such strenuous
      opposition to the old man&rsquo;s design that he consented to defer the
      operation till another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are acting foolishly, Cure,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;It would do this scoundrel
      good to be well bled; but, since it seems to displease you, I&rsquo;ll wait a
      little longer; I shall be meeting him again in some quiet corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the Brother broke out into a growl, Jeanbernat cried threateningly:
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t keep still I will cut your ears off at once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are sitting on his chest,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;get up and let him
      breathe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; he would begin his tomfoolery again. I will give him his liberty
      when I go away, but not before.... Well, I was telling you, Cure, when
      this good-for-nothing interrupted us, that you would be very welcome
      yonder. The little one is mistress, you know; I don&rsquo;t attempt to interfere
      with her any more than I do with my salad-plants. There are only fools
      like this croaker here who see any harm in it. Where did you see anything
      wrong, scoundrel? It was yourself who imagined it, villain that you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon he gave the Brother another shaking. &lsquo;Let him get up,&rsquo; 
      begged Abbe Mouret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-and-by. The little one has not been well for a long time. I did not
      notice anything myself, but she told me; and now I am on my way to tell
      your uncle Pascal, at Plassans. I like the night for walking; it is quiet,
      and, as a rule, one isn&rsquo;t delayed by meeting people.... Yes, yes, the
      little one is quite ailing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest could not find a word to say. He staggered, and his head sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It made her so happy to look after you,&rsquo; continued the old man. &lsquo;While I
      smoked my pipe I used to hear her laugh. That was quite sufficient for me.
      Girls are like the hawthorns; when they break out into blossom, they do
      all they can. Well, now, you will come, if your heart prompts you to it. I
      am sure it would please the little one. Good night, Cure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up slowly, keeping a firm grasp of the Brother&rsquo;s wrists, to guard
      against any treacherous attack. Then he proceeded on his way, with
      swinging strides, without once turning his head. The Brother silently
      crept to the heap of stones, and waited till the old man was some distance
      off. Then, with both hands, and with mad violence, he again began flinging
      stones, but they fell harmlessly upon the dusty road. Jeanbernat did not
      condescend to notice them, but went his way, upright like a tree, through
      the clear night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The accursed one!&mdash;Satan carries him on!&rsquo; shrieked Brother
      Archangias, as he hurled his last stone. &lsquo;An old scoundrel, that the least
      touch ought to upset! But he is baked in hell&rsquo;s fire. I smelt his claws.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother stamped with impotent rage on the scattered flints. Then he
      suddenly attacked Abbe Mouret. &lsquo;It was all your fault,&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;you
      ought to have helped me, and, between us, we could have strangled him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, at the other end of the village, the uproar in the Bambousses&rsquo; 
      house had become greater than ever. The rhythmic tapping of glasses on a
      table could be distinctly heard. The priest resumed his walk without
      raising his head, making his way towards the flood of bright light that
      streamed out of the window like the flare of a fire of vine-cuttings. The
      Brother followed him gloomily; his cassock soiled with dust, and one of
      his cheeks bleeding from a stone-cut. And, after a short interval of
      silence, he asked, in his harsh voice: &lsquo;Shall you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as Abbe Mouret did not answer, he went on: &lsquo;Take care! You are
      lapsing into sin again. It was sufficient for that man to pass by to send
      a thrill through your whole body. I saw you by the light of the moon
      looking as pale as a girl. Take care! take care! Do you hear me? Another
      time God will not pardon you&mdash;you will sink into the lowest abyss!
      Ah! wretched piece of clay that you are, filth is mastering you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, the priest at last raised his head. Big tears were streaming
      from his eyes, and it was in gentle heartbroken accents that he spoke:
      &lsquo;Why do you speak to me like that?&mdash;You are always with me, and you
      know my ceaseless struggles. Do not doubt me, leave me strength to master
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Those simple words, bathed with silent tears, fell on the night air with
      such an expression of superhuman suffering, that even Brother Archangias,
      in spite of all his harshness, felt touched. He made no reply, but shook
      his dusty cassock, and wiped his bleeding cheek. When they reached the
      Bambousses&rsquo; house, he refused to go inside. He seated himself, a few yards
      away, on the body of an overturned cart, where he waited for the Abbe with
      dog-like patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! here is Monsieur le Cure!&rsquo; cried all the company of Bambousses and
      Brichets as Serge entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They filled their glasses once more. Abbe Mouret was compelled to take
      one, too. There had been no regular wedding-feast; but, in the evening,
      after dinner, a ten-gallon &lsquo;Dame Jane&rsquo; had been placed upon the table, and
      they were making it their business to empty it before going to bed. There
      were ten of them, and old Bambousse was already with one hand tilting over
      the jar whence only a thread of red liquor now flowed. Rosalie, in a very
      sportive frame of mind, was dipping her baby&rsquo;s chin into her glass, while
      big Fortune showed off his strength by lifting up the chairs with his
      teeth. All the company passed into the bedroom. Custom required that the
      priest should there drink the glass of wine which had been poured out for
      him. It brought good luck, and prevented quarrels in the household. In
      Monsieur Caffin&rsquo;s time, it had always been a very merry ceremony, for the
      old priest loved a joke. He had even gained a reputation for the skilful
      way in which he could drain his glass, without leaving a single drop at
      the bottom of it; and the Artaud women pretended that every drop undrunk
      meant a year&rsquo;s less love for the newly married pair. But with Abbe Mouret
      they dare not joke so freely. However, he drank his wine at one gulp,
      which seemed to greatly please old Bambousse. Mother Brichet looked at the
      bottom of the glass and saw but a drop or two of the liquid remaining
      there. Then, after a few jokes, they all returned to the living room,
      where Vincent and Catherine had remained by themselves. Vincent, standing
      upon a chair, was clasping the huge jar in his arms, and draining the last
      drops of wine into Catherine&rsquo;s open mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are much obliged to you, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; said old Bambousse, as he
      escorted the priest to the door. &lsquo;Well, they&rsquo;re married now, so I suppose
      you are satisfied. And they are not likely to complain, I&rsquo;m sure.... Good
      night, sleep well, your reverence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias had slowly risen from his seat on the old cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May the devil pile hot coals over them, and roast them!&rsquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then without again opening his lips he accompanied Abbe Mouret to the
      parsonage. And he waited outside till the door was closed. Even then he
      did not go off without twice looking round to make sure that the Abbe was
      not coming out again. As for the priest, when he reached his bedroom, he
      threw himself in his clothes upon his bed, clasping his hands to his ears,
      and pressing his face to the pillow, in order that he might shut out all
      sound and sight. And thus stilling his senses he fell into death-like
      slumber.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday. As the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross
      fell on a high mass day, Abbe Mouret desired to celebrate the festival
      with especial solemnity. He was now full of extraordinary devotion for the
      Cross, and had replaced the image of the Immaculate Conception in his
      bedroom by a large crucifix of black wood, before which he spent long
      hours in worship. To exalt the Cross, to plant it before him, above all
      else, in a halo of glory, as the one object of his life, gave him the
      strength he needed to suffer and to struggle. He sometimes dreamed of
      hanging there himself, in Jesus&rsquo;s place, his head crowned with thorns,
      nails driven through his hands and feet, and his side rent by spears. What
      a coward he must be to complain of an imaginary wound, when God bled there
      from His whole body, and yet preserved on His lips the blessed smile of
      the Redemption! And however unworthy it might be, he offered up his wound
      as a sacrifice, ended by falling into ecstasy, and believing that blood
      did really stream from his brow and side and limbs. Those were hours of
      relief, for he fancied that all the impurity within him flowed forth from
      his wounds. And he then usually drew himself up with the heroism of a
      martyr, and longed to be called upon to suffer the most frightful
      tortures, in order that he might bear them without a quiver of the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At early dawn that day he knelt before the crucifix, and grace came upon
      him abundantly as dew. He made no effort, he simply fell upon his knees,
      to receive it in his heart, to be permeated with it to the marrow of his
      bones in sweetest and most refreshing fulness. On the previous day he had
      prayed for grace in agony, and it had not come. At times it long remained
      deaf to his entreaties, and then, when he simply clasped his hands, in
      quite childlike fashion, it flowed down to succour him. It came upon him
      that morning like a benediction, bringing perfect serenity, absolute
      trusting faith. He forgot his anguish of the previous days, and
      surrendered himself wholly to the triumphant joy of the Cross. He seemed
      to be cased in such impenetrable armour that the world&rsquo;s most deadly blows
      would glide off from it harmlessly. When he came down from his bedroom, he
      stepped along with an air of serenity and victory. La Teuse was
      astonished, and went to find Desiree, that he might kiss her; and both of
      them clapped their hands, and said that they had not seen him looking so
      well for the last six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in the church, at high mass, that the priest felt that he had
      really recovered divine grace. It was a long time since he had approached
      the altar with such loving emotion; and he had to make a great effort to
      restrain himself from weeping whilst he remained with his lips pressed to
      the altar-cloth. It was a solemn high mass. The local rural guard, an
      uncle of Rosalie, chanted in a deep bass voice which rumbled through the
      low nave like a hoarse organ. Vincent, robed in a surplice much too large
      for him, which had formerly belonged to Abbe Caffin, carried an old silver
      censer, and was vastly amused by the tinkling of its chains; he swung it
      to a great height, so as to produce copious clouds of smoke, and glanced
      behind him every now and then to see if he had succeeded in making any one
      cough. The church was almost full, for everybody wanted to see his
      reverence&rsquo;s painting. Peasant women laughed with pleasure because the
      place smelt so nice, while the men, standing under the gallery, jerked
      their heads approvingly at each deeper and deeper note that came from the
      rural guard. Filtering through the paper window panes the full morning sun
      lighted up the brightly painted walls, on which the women&rsquo;s caps cast
      shadows resembling huge butterflies. The artificial flowers, with which
      the altar was decorated, almost seemed to possess the moist freshness of
      natural ones newly gathered; and when the priest turned round to bless the
      congregation, he felt even stronger emotion than before, as he saw his
      church so clean, so full, and so steeped in music and incense and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the offertory, however, a buzzing murmur sped through the peasant
      women. Vincent inquisitively turned his head, and in doing so, almost let
      the charcoal in his censer fall upon the priest&rsquo;s chasuble. And, wishing
      to excuse himself, as he saw the Abbe looking at him with an expression of
      reproof, he murmured: &lsquo;It is your reverence&rsquo;s uncle, who has just come
      in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the church, standing beside one of the slender wooden
      pillars that supported the gallery, Abbe Mouret then perceived Doctor
      Pascal. The doctor was not wearing his usual cheerful and slightly
      scoffing expression. Hat in hand, he stood there looking very grave, and
      followed the service with evident impatience. The sight of the priest at
      the altar, his solemn demeanour, his slow gestures, and the perfect
      serenity of his countenance, appeared to gradually increase his
      irritation. He could not stay there till the end of the mass, but left the
      church, and walked up and down beside his horse and gig, which he had
      secured to one of the parsonage shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will that nephew of mine never have finished censing himself?&rsquo; he asked
      of La Teuse, who was just coming out of the vestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all over,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into the drawing-room? His
      reverence is unrobing. He knows you are here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, unless he were blind, he couldn&rsquo;t very well help it,&rsquo; growled the
      doctor, as he followed La Teuse into the cold-looking, stiffly furnished
      chamber, which she pompously called the drawing-room. Here for a few
      minutes he paced up and down. The gloomy coldness of his surroundings
      seemed to increase his irritation. As he strode about, flourishing a stick
      he carried, he kept on striking the well-worn chair-seats of horsehair
      which sounded hard and dead as stone. Then, tired of walking, he took his
      stand in front of the mantelpiece, in the centre of which a gaudily
      painted image of Saint Joseph occupied the place of a clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! here he comes at last,&rsquo; he said, as he heard the door opening. And
      stepping towards the Abbe he went on: &lsquo;Do you know that you made me listen
      to half a mass? It is a very long time since that happened to me. But I
      was bent on seeing you to-day. I have something to say to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stopped, and looked at the priest with an expression of surprise.
      Silence fell. &lsquo;You at all events are quite well,&rsquo; he resumed, in a
      different voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am very much better than I was,&rsquo; replied Abbe Mouret, with a
      smile. &lsquo;I did not expect you before Thursday. Sunday isn&rsquo;t your day for
      coming. Is there something you want to tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Pascal did not give an immediate answer. He went on looking at the
      Abbe. The latter was still fresh from the influence of the church and the
      mass. His hair was fragrant with the perfume of the incense, and in his
      eyes shone all the joy of the Cross. His uncle jogged his head, as he
      noticed that expression of triumphant peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come from the Paradou,&rsquo; he said, abruptly. &lsquo;Jeanbernat came to
      fetch me there. I have seen Albine, and she disquiets me. She needs much
      careful treatment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his eyes fixed upon the priest as he spoke, but he did not detect
      so much as a quiver of Serge&rsquo;s eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She took great care of you, you know,&rsquo; he added, more roughly. &lsquo;Without
      her, my boy, you might now be in one of the cells at Les Tulettes, with a
      strait waistcoat on.... Well, I promised that you would go to see her. I
      will take you with me. It will be a farewell meeting. She is anxious to go
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can do nothing more than pray for the person of whom you speak,&rsquo; said
      Abbe Mouret, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the doctor, losing his temper, brought his stick down heavily upon
      the couch, he added calmly, but in a firm voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a priest, and can only help with prayers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well! Yes, you are right,&rsquo; said Uncle Pascal, dropping down into an
      armchair, &lsquo;it is I who am an old fool. Yes, I wept like a child, as I came
      here alone in my gig. That is what comes of living amongst books. One
      learns a lot from them, but one makes a fool of oneself in the world. How
      could I guess that it would all turn out so badly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair and began to walk about again, looking exceedingly
      troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But yes, but yes, I ought to have guessed. It was all quite natural.
      Though with one in your position, it was bound to be abominable! You are
      not as other men. But listen to me, I assure you that otherwise you would
      never have recovered. It was she alone, with the atmosphere she set round
      you, who saved you from madness. There is no need for me to tell you what
      a state you were in. It is one of my most wonderful cures. But I can&rsquo;t
      take any pride, any pleasure in it, for now the poor girl is dying of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret remained there erect, perfectly calm, his face reflecting all
      the quiet serenity of a martyr whom nothing that man might do could
      disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God will take mercy upon her,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God! God!&rsquo; muttered the doctor below his breath. &lsquo;Ah! He would do better
      not to interfere. We might manage matters if we were left to ourselves.&rsquo; 
      Then, raising his voice, he added: &lsquo;I thought I had considered everything
      carefully, that is the most wonderful part of it. Oh! what a fool I was!
      You would stay there, I thought, for a month to recover your strength. The
      shade of the trees, the cheerful chatter of the girl, all the youthfulness
      about you would quickly bring you round. And then you, on your side, it
      seemed to me, would do something to reclaim the poor child from her wild
      ways; you would civilise her, and, between us, we should turn her into a
      young lady, for whom we should, by-and-by, find a suitable husband. It
      seemed such a perfect scheme. And then how was I to guess that old
      philosophising Jeanbernat would never stir an inch from his lettuce-beds?
      Well! well! I myself never left my own laboratory. I had such pressing
      work there.... And it is all my fault! Ah! I am a stupid bungler!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was choking, and wished to go off. And he began to look about him for
      his hat, though, all the while, he had it on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; he stammered; &lsquo;I am going. So you won&rsquo;t come? Do, now&mdash;for
      my sake! You see how miserable, how upset I am. I swear to you that she
      shall go away immediately afterwards. That is all settled. My gig is here;
      you might be back in an hour. Come, do come, I beg you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest made a sweeping gesture; such a gesture as the doctor had seen
      him make before the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I cannot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he accompanied his uncle out of the room, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell her to fall on her knees and pray to God. God will hear her as He
      heard me, and He will comfort her as He has comforted me. There is no
      other means of salvation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked him full in the face, and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, then,&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;You are quite well now, and have no
      further need of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he was unfastening his horse, Desiree, who had heard his voice,
      came running up. She was extremely attached to her uncle. When she had
      been younger he had been wont to listen to her childish prattle for hours
      without showing the least sign of weariness. And, even now, he did his
      best to spoil her, and manifested the greatest interest in her farmyard,
      often spending a whole afternoon with her amongst her fowls and ducks, and
      smiling at her with his bright eyes. He seemed to consider her superior to
      other girls. And so she now flung herself round his neck, in an impulse of
      affection, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to stay and have some lunch with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But having kissed her, he said he could not remain, and unfastened her
      arms from his neck with a somewhat pettish air. She laughed however, and
      again clasped her arms round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but you must,&rsquo; she persisted. &lsquo;I have some eggs that have only just
      been laid. I have been looking in the nests, and there are fourteen eggs
      this morning. And, if you will stay, we can have a fowl, the white one,
      that is always quarrelling with the others. When you were here on
      Thursday, you know, it pecked the big spotted hen&rsquo;s eye out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But her uncle persisted in his refusal. He was irritated to find that he
      could not unfasten the knot in which he had tied his reins. And then she
      began to skip round him, clapping her hands and repeating in a sing-song
      voice: &lsquo;Yes! yes! you&rsquo;ll stay, and we will eat it up, we&rsquo;ll eat it up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle could no longer resist her blandishments; he raised his head and
      smiled at her. She seemed so full of life and health and sincerity; her
      gaiety was as frank and natural as the sheet of sunlight which was gilding
      her bare arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You big silly!&rsquo; he said; and clasping her by the wrists as she continued
      skipping gleefully about him, he went on: &lsquo;No, dear; not to-day. I have to
      go to see a poor girl who is ill. But I will come some other morning. I
      promise you faithfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When? when?&rsquo; she persisted. &lsquo;On Thursday? The cow is in calf, you know,
      and she hasn&rsquo;t seemed at all well these last two days. You are a doctor,
      and you ought to be able to give her something to do her good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, who had calmly remained there, could not restrain a slight
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gaily got into his gig and exclaimed: &lsquo;All right, my dear, I
      will attend to your cow. Come and let me kiss you. Ah! how nice and
      healthy you are! And you are worth more than all the others put together.
      Ah! if every one was like my big silly, this earth would be too
      beautiful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his horse off with a cluck of his tongue, and continued talking to
      himself as the gig rattled down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes! there should be nothing but animals. Ah! if they were mere
      animals, how happy and gay and strong they would all be! It has gone well
      with the girl, who is as happy as her cow; but it has gone badly with the
      lad, who is in torture beneath his cassock. A drop too much blood, a
      little too much nerve, and one&rsquo;s whole life is wrecked! ... They are true
      Rougons and true Macquarts those children there! The tail-end of the stock&mdash;its
      final degeneracy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, urging on his horse, he drove at a trot up the hill that led to the
      Paradou.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday was a busy day for Abbe Mouret. He had to think of vespers, which
      he generally said to empty seats, for even mother Brichet did not carry
      her piety so far as to go back to church in the afternoon. Then, at four
      o&rsquo;clock, Brother Archangias brought the little rogues from his school to
      repeat their catechism to his reverence. This lesson sometimes lasted
      until late. When the children showed themselves quite intractable, La
      Teuse was summoned to frighten them with her broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that particular Sunday, about four o&rsquo;clock, Desiree found herself quite
      alone in the parsonage. As she felt a little bored, she went to gather
      some food for her rabbits in the churchyard, where there were some
      magnificent poppies, of which rabbits are extremely fond. Dragging herself
      about on her knees between the grave-stones, she gathered apronfuls of
      juicy verdure on which her pets fell greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! what lovely plantains!&rsquo; she muttered, stooping before Abbe Caffin&rsquo;s
      tombstone, and delighted with the discovery she had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, indeed, some magnificent plantains spreading out their broad
      leaves beside the stone. Desiree had just finished filling her apron with
      them when she fancied she heard a strange noise behind her. A rustling of
      branches and a rolling of small pebbles came from the ravine which skirted
      one side of the graveyard, and at the bottom of which flowed the Mascle, a
      stream which descended from the high lands of the Paradou. But the ascent
      here was so rough, so impracticable, that Desiree imagined that the noise
      could only have been made by some lost dog or straying goat. She stepped
      quickly to the edge, and, as she looked over, she was amazed to see amidst
      the brambles a girl who was climbing up the rocks with extraordinary
      agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give you a hand,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You might easily break your neck
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, directly she saw she was discovered, started back, as though she
      would rather go down again, but after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she ventured
      to take the hand that was held out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I know who you are,&rsquo; said Desiree, with a beaming smile, and letting
      her apron fall that she might grasp the girl by the waist. &lsquo;You once gave
      me some blackbirds, but they all died, poor little dears. I was so sorry
      about it.&mdash;Wait a bit, I know your name, I have heard it before. La
      Teuse often mentions it when Serge isn&rsquo;t there; but she told me that I was
      not to repeat it. Wait a moment, I shall remember it directly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to recall the name, and grew quite grave in the attempt. Then,
      having succeeded in remembering it, she became gay again, and seemingly
      found great pleasure in dwelling upon its musical sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albine! Albine!&mdash;&mdash; What a sweet name it is! At first I used to
      think you must be a tomtit, because I once had a tomtit with a name very
      like yours, though I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine did not smile. Her face was very pale, and there was a feverish
      gleam in her eyes. A few drops of blood trickled from her hands. When she
      had recovered her breath, she hastily exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      No! no! leave it alone. You will only stain your handkerchief. It is
      nothing but a scratch. I didn&rsquo;t want to come by the road, as I should have
      been seen&mdash;so I preferred coming along the bed of the torrent&mdash;&mdash;
      Is Serge there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree did not feel at all shocked at hearing the girl pronounce her
      brother&rsquo;s name thus familiarly and with an expression of subdued passion.
      She simply replied that he was in the church hearing the children say
      their catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not speak at all loudly,&rsquo; she added, raising her finger to her
      lips. &lsquo;Serge forbade me to talk loudly when he is catechising the
      children, and we shall get into trouble if we don&rsquo;t keep quiet. Let us go
      into the stable&mdash;shall we? We can talk better there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to see Serge,&rsquo; said Albine, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree cast a hasty glance at the church, and then whispered, &lsquo;Yes, yes;
      Serge will be finely caught. Come with me. We will hide ourselves, and
      keep quite quiet. We shall have some fine fun!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had picked up the herbage which had fallen from her apron, and
      quitting the graveyard she stole back to the parsonage, telling Albine to
      hide herself behind her and make herself as little as possible. As they
      stealthily glided through the farmyard, they caught sight of La Teuse, who
      was crossing over to the vestry, but she did not appear to notice them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! There!&rsquo; said Desiree, quite delighted, as they stowed themselves
      away in the stable; &lsquo;keep quiet, and no one will know that we are here.
      There is some straw there for you to lie down upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine seated herself on a truss of straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Serge?&rsquo; she asked, persisting in her one fixed idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen! You can hear his voice. When he claps his hands, it will be all
      over, and the children will go away&mdash;Listen! he is telling them a
      tale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They could indeed just hear Abbe Mouret&rsquo;s voice, which was wafted to them
      through the vestry doorway which La Teuse had doubtless left open. It came
      to them like a solemn murmur, in which they could distinguish the name of
      Jesus thrice repeated. Albine trembled. She sprang up as though to hasten
      to that beloved voice whose caressing accents she knew so well, but all
      sound of it suddenly died away, shut off by the closing of the door. Then
      she sat down again, to wait, her hands tightly clasped, and her clear eyes
      gleaming with the intensity of her thoughts. Desiree, who was lying at her
      feet, gazed up at her with innocent admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How beautiful you are!&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;You are like an image that Serge
      used to have in his bedroom. It was quite white like you are, with great
      curls floating about the neck; and the heart was quite bare and uncovered,
      just in the place where I can feel yours beating&mdash;&mdash; But you are
      not listening to me. You are looking quite sad. Let us play at something?
      Will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stopped short, holding her breath and saying between her teeth:
      &lsquo;Ah! the wretches! they will get us caught!&rsquo; She still had her apron full
      of herbage with her, and her pets were taking it by assault. A troop of
      fowls had surrounded her, clucking and calling each other, and pecking at
      the hanging green stuff. The goat pushed its head slyly under her arm, and
      began to eat the longer leaves. Even the cow, which was tethered to the
      wall, strained at its cord and poked out its nose, kissing her with its
      warm breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you thieves!&rsquo; cried Desiree. &lsquo;But this is for the rabbits, not for
      you! Leave me alone, won&rsquo;t you! You, there, will get your ears boxed, if
      you don&rsquo;t go away! And you too will have your tail pulled if I catch you
      at it again. The wretches! they will be eating my hands soon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove the goat off, dispersed the fowls with her feet, and tapped the
      cow&rsquo;s nose with her fists. But the creatures just shook themselves, and
      then came back more greedily than ever, surrounding her, jumping on her,
      and tearing open her apron. At this she whispered to Albine, as though she
      were afraid the animals might hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they amusing, the dears? Watch them eat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine looked on with a grave expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, now, be good,&rsquo; resumed Desiree; &lsquo;you shall all have some, but you
      must wait your turns. Now, big Lisa, you first. Eh! how fond you are of
      plantain, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Lisa was the cow. She slowly munched a handful of the juicy leaves
      which had grown beside Abbe Caffin&rsquo;s tomb. A thread of saliva hung down
      from her mouth, and her great brown eyes shone with quiet enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! now it&rsquo;s your turn,&rsquo; continued Desiree, turning towards the goat.
      &lsquo;You are fond of poppies, I know; and you like the flowers best, don&rsquo;t
      you? The buds that shine in your teeth like red-hot butterflies! See, here
      are some splendid ones; they came from the left-hand corner, where there
      was a burial last year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she gave the goat a bunch of scarlet flowers, which the
      animal ate from her hand. When there was nothing left in her grasp but the
      stalks, she pushed these between its teeth. Behind her, in the meanwhile,
      the fowls were desperately pecking away at her petticoats. She threw them
      some wild chicory and dandelions which she had gathered amongst the old
      slabs that were ranged alongside the church walls. It was particularly
      over the dandelions that the fowls quarrelled, so voraciously indeed, with
      such scratchings and flapping of wings, that the other fowls in the yard
      heard them. And then came a general invasion. The big yellow cock,
      Alexander, was the first to appear; having seized a dandelion and torn it
      in halves, without attempting to eat it, he called to the hens who were
      still outside to come and peck. Then a white hen strutted in, then a black
      one, and then a whole crowd of hens, who hustled one another, and trod on
      one another&rsquo;s tails, and ended by forming a wild flood of feathers. Behind
      the fowls came the pigeons, and the ducks, and the geese, and, last of
      all, the turkeys. Desiree laughed at seeing herself thus surrounded by
      this noisy, squabbling mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is what always happens,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;every time that I bring any
      green stuff from the graveyard. They nearly kill each other to get at it;
      they must find it very nice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she made a fight to keep a few handfuls of the leaves from the greedy
      beaks which rose all round her, saying that something must really be saved
      for the rabbits. She would surely get angry with them if they went on like
      that, and give them nothing but dry bread in future. However, she was
      obliged to give way. The geese tugged at her apron so violently that she
      was almost pulled down upon her knees; the ducks gobbled away at her
      ankles; two of the pigeons flew upon her head, and some of the fowls
      fluttered about her shoulders. It was the ferocity of creatures who smell
      flesh: the fat plantains, the crimson poppies, the milky dandelions, in
      which remained some of the life of the dead. Desiree laughed loudly, and
      felt that she was on the point of slipping down, and letting go of her
      last two handfuls, when the fowls were panic-stricken by a terrible
      grunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, my fatty,&rsquo; she exclaimed, quite delighted; &lsquo;eat them up,
      and set me at liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pig waddled in; he was no longer the little pig of former days&mdash;pink
      as a newly painted toy, with a tiny little tail, like a bit of string; but
      a fat wobbling creature, fit to be killed, with a belly as round as a
      monk&rsquo;s, and a back all bristling with rough hairs, that reeked of fatness.
      His stomach had grown quite yellow from his habit of sleeping on the
      manure heap. Waddling along on his shaky feet, he charged with lowered
      snout at the scared fowls, and so left Desiree at liberty to escape, and
      take the rabbits the few scraps of green stuff which she had so
      strenuously defended. When she came back, all was peace again. The stupid,
      ecstatic-looking geese were lazily swaying their long necks about, the
      ducks and turkeys were waddling in ungainly fashion alongside the wall;
      the fowls were quietly clucking and peaking at invisible grains on the
      hard ground of the stable; while the pig, the goat, and the big cow, were
      drowsily blinking their eyes, as though they were falling asleep. Outside
      it had just begun to rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! well, there&rsquo;s a shower coming on!&rsquo; cried Desiree, throwing herself
      down on the straw. &lsquo;You had better stay where you are, my dears, if you
      don&rsquo;t want to get soaked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to Albine and added: &lsquo;How stupid they all look, don&rsquo;t
      they? They only wake up just to eat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine still remained silent. The merry laughter of that buxom girl as she
      struggled amidst those greedy necks and gluttonous beaks, which tickled
      and kissed her, and seemed bent on devouring her very flesh, had rendered
      the unhappy daughter of the Paradou yet paler than she had been before. So
      much gaiety, so much vitality, so much boisterous health made her despair.
      She strained her feverish arms to her desolate bosom, which desertion had
      parched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Serge?&rsquo; she asked again, in the same clear, stubborn voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Desiree. &lsquo;I heard him just now. He hasn&rsquo;t finished yet&mdash;&mdash;
      We have been making a pretty disturbance; La Teuse must surely have grown
      deaf this afternoon&mdash;&mdash; Let us keep quiet now. I like to hear
      the rain fall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shower beat in at the open doorway, casting big drops upon the
      threshold. The restless fowls, after venturing out for a moment, had
      quickly retreated to the far end of the stable; where, indeed, with the
      exception of three ducks who remained quietly walking in the rain, all the
      pets had now taken refuge, clustering round the girl&rsquo;s skirts. It was
      growing very warm amongst the straw. Desiree pulled two big trusses
      together, made a bed of them, and lay down at full length. She felt
      extremely comfortable there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so nice,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;Come and lie down like me. It is so
      springy and soft, all this straw; and it tickles one so funnily in the
      neck. Do you roll about in the straw at home? There is nothing I am fonder
      of&mdash;&mdash; Sometimes I tickle the soles of my feet with it. That is
      very funny, too&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment, the big yellow cock, who had been gravely stalking
      towards her, jumped upon her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get away with you, Alexander! get away!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;What a tiresome
      creature he is! The idea of his perching himself on me&mdash;&mdash; You
      are too rough, sir, and you scratch me with your claws. Do you hear me? I
      don&rsquo;t want you to go away, but you must be good, and mustn&rsquo;t peck at my
      hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she troubled herself no further about him. The cock still maintained
      his position, every now and then glancing inquisitively at the girl&rsquo;s chin
      with his gleaming eye. The other birds all began to cluster round her.
      After rolling amongst the straw, she was now lying lazily on her back with
      her arms stretched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! how pleasant it is,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but then it makes me feel so sleepy.
      Straw always makes one drowsy, doesn&rsquo;t it? Serge doesn&rsquo;t like it. Perhaps
      you don&rsquo;t either. What do you like? Tell me, so that I may know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gradually dozing off. For a moment she opened her eyes widely, as
      though she were looking for something, and then her eyelids fell with a
      tranquil smile of content. She seemed to be asleep, but after a few
      minutes she opened her eyes again, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cow is going to have a calf&mdash;&mdash; That will be so nice, and
      will please me more than anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sank into deep slumber. The fowls had ended by perching on her
      body; she was buried beneath a wave of living plumage. Hens were brooding
      over her feet; geese stretched their soft downy necks over her legs. The
      pig lay against her left side, while on the right, the goat poked its
      bearded head under her arm. The pigeons were roosting and nestling all
      over her, on her hands, her waist, and her shoulders. And there she lay
      asleep, in all her rosy freshness, caressed by the cow&rsquo;s warm breath,
      while the big cock still squatted just below her bosom with gleaming comb
      and quivering wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the rain was falling less heavily. A sunbeam, escaping from
      beneath a cloud, gilded the fine drops of water. Albine, who had remained
      perfectly still, watched the slumber of Desiree, that big, plump girl who
      found her great delight in rolling about in the straw. She wished that
      she, too, could slumber away so peacefully, and feel such pleasure,
      because a few straws had tickled her neck. And she felt jealous of those
      strong arms, that firm bosom, all that vitality, all that purely animal
      development which made the other like a tranquil easy-minded sister of the
      big red and white cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the rain had now quite ceased. The three cats of the parsonage
      filed out into the yard one after the other, keeping close to the wall,
      and taking the greatest precautions to avoid wetting their paws. They
      peeped into the stable, and then stalked up to the sleeping girl, and lay
      down, purring, close by her. Moumou, the big black cat, curled itself up
      close to her cheek, and gently licked her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Serge?&rsquo; murmured Albine, quite mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it that kept them apart? Who was it that prevented them from
      being happy together? Why might she not love him, and why might she not be
      loved, freely and in the broad sunlight, as the trees lived and loved? She
      knew not, but she felt that she had been forsaken, and had received a
      mortal wound. Yet she was possessed by a stubborn, determined longing, a
      very necessity, indeed, of once more clasping her love in her arms, of
      concealing him somewhere, that he might be hers in all felicity. She rose
      to her feet. The vestry door had just been opened again. A clapping of
      hands sounded, followed by the uproar of a swarm of children clattering in
      wooden shoes over the stone flags. The catechising was over. Then Albine
      gently glided out of the stable, where she had been waiting for an hour
      amidst the reeking warmth that emanated from Desiree&rsquo;s pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she quietly slipped through the passage that led to the vestry, she
      caught sight of La Teuse, who was going to her kitchen, and who
      fortunately did not turn her head. Certain, now, of not being seen and
      stopped, Albine softly pushed the door which was before her, keeping hold
      of it in order that it might make no noise as it closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she found herself in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0047" id="link2H_4_0047">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>
    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At first she could see nobody. Outside, the rain had again begun to fall
      in fine close drops. The church looked very grey and gloomy. She passed
      behind the high altar, and walked on towards the pulpit. In the middle of
      the nave, there were only a number of empty benches, left there in
      disorder by the urchins of the catechism class. Amidst all this void came
      a low tic-tac from the swaying pendulum. She went down the church to knock
      at the confessional-box, which she saw standing at the other end. But,
      just as she passed the Chapel of the Dead, she caught sight of Abbe Mouret
      prostrated before the great bleeding Christ. He did not stir; he must have
      thought that it was only La Teuse putting the seats in order behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albine laid her hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I have come for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest raised his head with a start. His face was very pale. He
      remained on his knees and crossed himself, while his lips still quivered
      with the words of his prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been waiting for you,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;Every morning and every
      evening I looked to see if you were not coming. I have counted the days
      till I could keep the reckoning no longer. Ah! for weeks and weeks&mdash;&mdash;
      Then, when I grew sure that you were not coming, I set out myself, and
      came here. I said to myself: &ldquo;I will fetch him away with me.&rdquo; Give me your
      hand and let us go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hands, as though to help him to rise. But he only
      crossed himself, afresh. He still continued his prayers as he looked at
      her. He had succeeded in calming the first quiver of his flesh. From the
      Divine grace which had been streaming around him since the early morning,
      like a celestial bath, he derived a superhuman strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not right for you to be here,&rsquo; he said, gravely. &lsquo;Go away. You are
      aggravating your sufferings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suffer no longer,&rsquo; she said, with a smile. &lsquo;I am well again; I am
      cured, now that I see you once more&mdash;&mdash; Listen! I made myself
      out worse than I really was, to induce them to go and fetch you. I am
      quite willing to confess it now. And that promise of going away, of
      leaving the neighbourhood, you didn&rsquo;t suppose I should have kept it, did
      you? No, indeed, unless I had carried you away with me on my shoulders.
      The others don&rsquo;t know it, but you must know that I cannot now live
      anywhere but at your side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew quite cheerful again, and drew close to the priest with the
      caressing ways of a child of nature, never noticing his cold and rigid
      demeanour. And she became impatient, clapped her hands, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Serge; make up your mind and come. We are only losing time. There
      is no necessity to think so much about it. It is quite simple; I am going
      to take you with me. If you don&rsquo;t want any one to see you, we will go
      along by the Mascle. It is not very easy walking, but I managed it all by
      myself; and, when we are together, we can help each other. You know the
      way, don&rsquo;t you? We cross the churchyard, we descend to the torrent, and
      then we shall only have to follow its course right up to the garden. And
      one is quite at home down there. Nobody can see us, there is nothing but
      brambles and big round stones. The bed of the stream is nearly dry. As I
      came along, I thought: &ldquo;By-and-by, when he is with me, we will walk along
      gently together and kiss one another.&rdquo; Come, Serge, be quick; I am waiting
      for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest no longer appeared to hear her. He had betaken himself to his
      prayers again, and was asking Heaven to grant him the courage of the
      saints. Before entering upon the supreme struggle, he was arming himself
      with the flaming sword of faith. For a moment he had feared he was
      wavering. He had required all a martyr&rsquo;s courage and endurance to remain
      firmly kneeling there on the flagstones, while Albine was calling him: his
      heart had leapt out towards her, all his blood had surged passionately
      through his veins, filling him with an intense yearning to clasp her in
      his arms and kiss her hair. Her mere breath had awakened all the memory of
      their love; the vast garden, their saunters beneath the trees, and all the
      joy of their companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Divine grace was poured down upon him more abundantly, and the
      torturing strife, during which all his blood seemed to quit his veins,
      lasted but a moment. Nothing human then remained within him. He had become
      wholly God&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine, however, again touched him on the shoulder. She was growing uneasy
      and angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you not speak to me?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t refuse; you will come
      with me? Remember that I shall die if you refuse. But no! you can&rsquo;t; it is
      impossible. We lived together once; it was vowed that we should never
      separate. Twenty times, at least, did you give yourself to me. You bade me
      take you wholly, your limbs, your breath, your very life itself. I did not
      dream it all. There is nothing of you that you have not given to me; not a
      hair in your head which is not mine. Your hands are mine. For days and
      days have I held them clasped in mine. Your face, your lips, your eyes,
      your brow, all, all are mine, and I have lavished my love upon them. Do
      you hear me, Serge?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood erect before him, full of proud assertion, with outstretched
      arms. And, in a louder voice, she repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear me, Serge? You belong to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Abbe Mouret slowly rose to his feet. He leant against the altar, and
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. You are mistaken. I belong to God.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of serenity. His shorn face seemed like that of some stone
      saint, whom no impulse of the flesh can disturb. His cassock fell around
      him in straight folds like a black winding-sheet, concealing all the
      outlines of his body. Albine dropped back at the sight of that sombre
      phantom of her former love. She missed his freely flowing beard, his
      freely flowing curls. And in the midst of his shorn locks she saw the
      pallid circle of his tonsure, which disquieted her as if it had been some
      mysterious evil, some malignant sore which had grown there, and would eat
      away all memory of the happy days they had spent together. She could
      recognise neither his hands, once so warm with caresses, nor his lissom
      neck, once so sonorous with laughter; nor his agile feet, which had
      carried her into the recesses of the woodlands. Could this, indeed, be the
      strong youth with whom she had lived one whole season&mdash;the youth with
      soft down gleaming on his bare breast, with skin browned by the sun&rsquo;s
      rays, with every limb full of vibrating life? At this present hour he
      seemed fleshless; his hair had fallen away from him, and all his virility
      had withered within that womanish gown, which left him sexless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you frighten me,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;Did you think then that I was dead,
      that you put on mourning? Take off that black thing; put on a blouse. You
      can tuck up the sleeves, and we will catch crayfishes again. Your arms
      used to be as white as mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on his cassock, as though to tear it off him; but he
      repulsed her with a gesture, without touching her. He looked at her now
      and strengthened himself against temptation by never allowing his eyes to
      leave her. She seemed to him to have grown taller. She was no longer the
      playful damsel adorned with bunches of wild-flowers, and casting to the
      winds gay, gipsy laughter, nor was she the amorosa in white skirts,
      gracefully bending her slender form as she sauntered lingeringly beside
      the hedges. Now, there was a velvety bloom upon her lips; her hips were
      gracefully rounded; her bosom was in full bloom. She had become a woman,
      with a long oval face that seemed expressive of fruitfulness. Life
      slumbered within her. And her cheeks glowed with luscious maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, bathed in the voluptuous atmosphere that seemed to emanate
      from all that feminine ripeness, took a bitter pleasure in defying the
      caresses of her coral lips, the tempting smile of her eyes, the witching
      charm of her bosom, and all the intoxication which seemed to pour from her
      at every movement. He even carried his temerity so far as to search with
      his gaze for the spots that he had once so hotly kissed, the corners of
      her eyes and lips, her narrow temples, soft as satin, and the ambery nape
      of her neck, which was like velvet. And never, even in her embrace, had he
      tasted such felicity as he now felt in martyring himself, by boldly
      looking in the face the love that he refused. At last, fearing lest he
      might there yield to some new allurement of the flesh, he dropped his
      eyes, and said, very gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot hear you here. Let us go out, if you, indeed, persist in adding
      to the pain of both of us. Our presence in this place is a scandal. We are
      in God&rsquo;s house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God!&rsquo; cried Albine, excitedly, suddenly becoming a child of nature once
      more. &lsquo;God! Who is He? I know nothing of your God! I want to know nothing
      of Him if He has stolen you away from me, who have never harmed Him. My
      uncle Jeanbernat was right then when he said that your God was only an
      invention to frighten people, and make them weep! You are lying; you love
      me no longer, and that God of yours does not exist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are in His house now,&rsquo; said Abbe Mouret, sternly. &lsquo;You blaspheme.
      With a breath He might turn you into dust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed with proud disdain, and raised her hands as if to defy Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! then,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you prefer your God to me. You think He is stronger
      than I am, and you imagine that He will love you better than I did. Oh!
      but you are a child, a foolish child. Come, leave all this folly. We will
      return to the garden together, and love each other, and be happy and free.
      That, that is life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she succeeded in throwing an arm round his waist, and she tried
      to drag him away. But he, quivering all over, freed himself from her
      embrace, and again took his stand against the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away!&rsquo; he faltered. &lsquo;If you still love me, go away.... O Lord, pardon
      her, and pardon me too, for thus defiling this Thy house. Should I go with
      her beyond the door, I might, perhaps, follow her. Here, in Thy presence,
      I am strong. Suffer that I may remain here, to protect Thee from insult.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine remained silent for a moment. Then, in a calm voice, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let us stay here, then. I wish to speak to you. You cannot, surely,
      be cruel. You will understand me. You will not let me go away alone. Oh!
      do not begin to excuse yourself. I will not lay my hands upon you again,
      since it distresses you. I am quite calm now as you can see. We will talk
      quietly, as we used to do in the old days when we lost our way, and did
      not hurry to find it again, that we might have the more time to talk
      together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at that memory, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about these things myself. My uncle Jeanbernat used to
      forbid me to go to church. &ldquo;Silly girl,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say to me, &ldquo;why do you want
      to go to a stuffy building when you have got a garden to run about in?&rdquo; I
      grew up quite happy and contented. I used to look in the birds&rsquo; nests
      without even taking the eggs. I did not even pluck the flowers, for fear
      of hurting the plants; and you know that I could never torture an insect.
      Why, then, should God be angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should learn to know Him, pray to Him, and render Him the constant
      worship which is His due,&rsquo; answered the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it would please you if I did, would it not?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You would
      forgive me, and love me again? Well, I will do all that you wish me. Tell
      me about God, and I will believe in Him, and worship Him. All that you
      tell me shall be a truth to which I will listen on my knees. Have I ever
      had a thought that was not your own? We will begin our long walks again;
      and you shall teach me, and make of me whatever you will. Say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I beg
      of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret pointed to his cassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; he simply said. &lsquo;I am a priest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A priest!&rsquo; she repeated after him, the smile dying out of her eyes. &lsquo;My
      uncle says that priests have neither wife, nor sister, nor mother. So that
      is true, then. But why did you ever come? It was you who took me for your
      sister, for your wife. Were you then lying?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest raised his pale face, moist with the sweat of agony. &lsquo;I have
      sinned,&rsquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I saw you so free,&rsquo; the girl went on, &lsquo;I thought that you were no
      longer a priest. I believed that all that was over, that you would always
      remain there with me, and for my sake.&mdash;&mdash; And now, what would
      you have me do, if you rob me of my whole life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I do,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;kneel down, suffer on your knees, and never
      rise until God pardons you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a coward, then?&rsquo; she exclaimed, her anger roused once more, her
      lips curving scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered, and kept silence. Agony held him by the throat; but he
      proved stronger than pain. He held his head erect, and a smile almost
      played about his trembling lips. Albine for a moment defied him with her
      fixed glance; then, carried away by a fresh burst of passion, she
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, answer me. Accuse me! Say it was I who came to tempt you! That will
      be the climax! Speak, and say what you can for yourself. Strike me if you
      like. I should prefer your blows to that corpse-like stiffness you put on.
      Is there no blood left in your veins? Have you no spirit? Don&rsquo;t you hear
      me calling you a coward? Yes, indeed, you are a coward. You should never
      have loved me, since you may not be a man. Is it that black robe of yours
      which holds you back? Tear it off! When you are naked, perhaps you will
      remember yourself again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest slowly repeated his former words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sinned. I had no excuse for my sin. I do penitence for my sin
      without hope of pardon. If I tore off my cassock, I should tear away my
      very flesh, for I have given myself wholly to God, soul and body. I am a
      priest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I! what is to become of me?&rsquo; cried Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked unflinchingly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May your sufferings be reckoned against me as so many crimes! May I be
      eternally punished for the desertion in which I am forced to leave you!
      That will be only just. All unworthy though I be, I pray for you each
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders with an air of great discouragement. Her anger
      was subsiding. She almost felt inclined to pity him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mad,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;Keep your prayers. It is you yourself that I
      want. But you will never understand me. There were so many things I wanted
      to tell you! Yet you stand there and irritate me with your chatter of
      another world. Come, let us try to talk sensibly. Let us wait for a moment
      till we are calmer. You cannot dismiss me in this way, I cannot leave you
      here. It is because you are here that you are so corpse-like, so cold that
      I dare not touch you. We won&rsquo;t talk any more just now. We will wait a
      little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased speaking, and took a few steps, examining the little church.
      The rain was still gently pattering against the windows; and the cold damp
      light seemed to moisten the walls. Not a sound came from outside save the
      monotonous plashing of the rain. The sparrows were doubtless crouching for
      shelter under the tiles, and the rowan-tree&rsquo;s deserted branches showed but
      indistinctly in the veiling, drenching downpour. Five o&rsquo;clock struck,
      grated out, stroke by stroke, from the wheezy chest of the old clock; and
      then the silence fell again, seeming to grow yet deeper, dimmer, and more
      despairing. The priest&rsquo;s painting work, as yet scarcely dry, gave to the
      high altar and the wainscoting an appearance of gloomy cleanliness, like
      that of some convent chapel where the sun never shines. Grievous anguish
      seemed to fill the nave, splashed with the blood that flowed from the
      limbs of the huge Christ; while, along the walls, the fourteen scenes of
      the Passion displayed their awful story in red and yellow daubs, reeking
      with horror. It was life that was suffering the last agonies there, amidst
      that deathlike quiver of the atmosphere, upon those altars which resembled
      tombs, in that bare vault which looked like a sepulchre. The surroundings
      all spoke of slaughter and gloom, terror and anguish and nothingness. A
      faint scent of incense still lingered there, like the last expiring breath
      of some dead girl, who had been hurriedly stifled beneath the flagstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Albine at last, &lsquo;how sweet it used to be in the sunshine! Don&rsquo;t
      you remember? One morning we walked past a hedge of tall rose bushes, to
      the left of the flower-garden. I recollect the very colour of the grass;
      it was almost blue, shot with green. When we reached the end of the hedge
      we turned and walked back again, so sweet was the perfume of the sunny
      air. And we did nothing else, that morning; we took just twenty paces
      forward and then twenty paces back. It was so sweet a spot you would not
      leave it. The bees buzzed all around; and there was a tomtit that never
      left us, but skipped along by our side from branch to branch. You
      whispered to me, &ldquo;How delightful is life!&rdquo; Ah! life! it was the green
      grass, the trees, the running waters, the sky, and the sun, amongst which
      we seemed all fair and golden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She mused for another moment and then continued: &lsquo;Life &lsquo;twas the Paradou.
      How vast it used to seem to us! Never were we able to find the end of it.
      The sea of foliage rolled freely with rustling waves as far as the eye
      could reach. And all that glorious blue overhead! we were free to grow,
      and soar, and roam, like the clouds without meeting more obstacles than
      they. The very air was ours!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and pointed to the low walls of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, here, you are in a grave. You cannot stretch out your hand without
      hurting it against the stones. The roof hides the sky from you and blots
      out the sun. It is all so small and confined that your limbs grow stiff
      and cramped as though you were buried alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the priest. &lsquo;The church is wide as the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she waved her hands towards the crosses, and the dying Christ, and the
      pictures of the Passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you live in the very midst of death. The grass, the trees, the
      springs, the sun, the sky, all are in the death throes around you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; all revives, all grows purified and reascends to the source of
      light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now drawn himself quite erect, with flashing eyes. And feeling that
      he was now invincible, so permeated with faith as to disdain temptation,
      he quitted the altar, took Albine&rsquo;s hand, and led her, as though she had
      been his sister, to the ghastly pictures of the Stations of the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is what God suffered! Jesus is cruelly scourged.
      Look! His shoulders are naked; His flesh is torn; His blood flows down His
      back.... And Jesus is crowned with thorns. Tears of blood trickle down His
      gashed brow. On His temple is a jagged wound.... Again Jesus is insulted
      by the soldiers. His murderers have scoffingly thrown a purple robe around
      His shoulders, and they spit upon His face and strike Him, and press the
      thorny crown deep into His flesh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine turned away her head, that she might not see the crudely painted
      pictures, in which the ochreous flesh of Christ had been plentifully
      bedaubed with carmine wounds. The purple robe round His shoulders seemed
      like a shred of His skin torn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why suffer? why die?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;O Serge, if you would only remember!...
      You told me, that morning, that you were tired. But I knew that you were
      only pretending, for the air was quite cool and we had only been walking
      for a quarter of an hour. But you wanted to sit down that you might hold
      me in your arms. Right down in the orchard, by the edge of a stream, there
      was a cherry tree&mdash;you remember it, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;which you never
      could pass without wishing to kiss my hands. And your kisses ran all up my
      arms and shoulders to my lips. Cherry time was over, and so you devoured
      my lips.... It used to make us feel so sad to see the flowers fading, and
      one day, when you found a dead bird in the grass, you turned quite pale,
      and caught me to your breast, as if to forbid the earth to take me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the priest drew her towards the other Stations of the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! hush!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;look here, and here! Bow down in grief and pity&mdash;&mdash;
      Jesus falls beneath the weight of His cross. The ascent of Calvary is very
      tiring. He has dropped down on His knees. But He does not stay to wipe
      even the sweat from His brow, He rises up again and continues His
      journey.... And again Jesus falls beneath the weight of His cross. At each
      step He staggers. This time He has fallen on His side, so heavily that for
      a moment He lies there quite breathless. His lacerated hands have relaxed
      their hold upon the cross. His bruised and aching feet leave blood-stained
      prints behind them. Agonising weariness overwhelms Him, for He carries
      upon His shoulders the sins of the whole world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine gazed at the pictured Jesus, lying in a blue shirt prostrate
      beneath the cross, the blackness of which bedimmed the gold of His
      aureole. Then, with her glance wandering far away, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! those meadow-paths! Have you no memory left, Serge? Have you
      forgotten those soft grassy walks through the meadows, amidst very seas of
      greenery? On the afternoon I am telling you of, we had only meant to stay
      out of doors an hour; but we went wandering on and were still wandering
      when the stars came out above us. Ah! how velvety it was, that endless
      carpet, soft as finest silk! It was just like a green sea whose gentle
      waters lapped us round. And well we knew whither those beguiling paths
      that led nowhere, were taking us! They were taking us to our love, to the
      joy of living together, to the certainty of happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With his hands trembling with anguish, Abbe Mouret pointed to the
      remaining pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jesus,&rsquo; he stammered, &lsquo;Jesus is nailed to the cross. The nails are
      hammered through His outspread hands. A single nail suffices for his feet,
      whose bones split asunder. He, Himself, while His flesh quivers with pain,
      fixes His eyes upon heaven and smiles.... Jesus is crucified between two
      thieves. The weight of His body terribly aggravates His wounds. From His
      brow, from His limbs, does a bloody sweat stream down. The two thieves
      insult Him, the passers-by mock at Him, the soldiers cast lots for His
      raiment. And the shadowy darkness grows deeper and the sun hides
      himself.... Jesus dies upon the cross. He utters a piercing cry and gives
      up the ghost. Oh! most terrible of deaths! The veil of the temple is rent
      in twain from top to bottom. The earth quakes, the stones are broken, and
      the very graves open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had fallen on his knees, his voice choked by sobs, his eyes
      fixed upon the three crosses of Calvary, where writhed the gaunt pallid
      bodies of the crucified. Albine placed herself in front of the paintings
      in order that he might no longer see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One evening,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I lay through the long gloaming with my head
      upon your lap. It was in the forest, at the end of that great avenue of
      chestnut-trees, through which the setting sun shot a parting ray. Ah! what
      a caressing farewell He bade us! He lingered awhile by our feet with a
      kindly smile, as if saying &ldquo;Till to-morrow.&rdquo; The sky slowly grew paler. I
      told you merrily that it was taking off its blue gown, and donning its
      gold-flowered robe of black to go out for the evening. And it was not
      night that fell, but a soft dimness, a veil of love and mystery, reminding
      us of those dusky paths, where the foliage arches overhead, one of those
      paths in which one hides for a moment with the certainty of finding the
      joyousness of daylight at the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That evening the calm clearness of the twilight gave promise of a
      splendid morrow. When I saw that it did not grow dark as quickly as you
      wished, I pretended to fall asleep. I may confess it to you now, but I was
      not really sleeping while you kissed me on the eyes. I felt your kisses
      and tried to keep from laughing. And then, when the darkness really came,
      it was like one long caress. The trees slept no more than I did. At night,
      don&rsquo;t you remember, the flowers always breathed a stronger perfume.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he still remained on his knees, while tears streamed down his
      face, she caught him by the wrists, and pulled him to his feet, resuming
      passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if you knew you would bid me carry you off; you would fasten your
      arms about my neck, lest I should go away without you.... Yesterday I had
      a longing to see the garden once more. It seems larger, deeper, more
      unfathomable than ever. I discovered there new scents, so sweetly aromatic
      that they brought tears into my eyes. In the avenues I found a rain of
      sunbeams that thrilled me with desire. The roses spoke to me of you. The
      bullfinches were amazed at seeing me alone. All the garden broke out into
      sighs. Oh! come! Never has the grass spread itself out more softly. I have
      marked with a flower the hidden nook whither I long to take you. It is a
      nest of greenery in the midst of a tangle of brushwood. And there one can
      hear all the teeming life of the garden, of the trees and the streams and
      the sky. The earth&rsquo;s very breathing will softly lull us to rest there. Oh!
      come! come! and let us love one another amidst that universal loving!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he pushed her from him. He had returned to the Chapel of the Dead and
      stood in front of the painted papier-mache Christ, big as a ten-year-old
      boy, that writhed in such horridly realistic agony. There were real iron
      nails driven into the figure&rsquo;s limbs, and the wounds gaped in the torn and
      bleeding flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Jesus, Who hast died for us!&rsquo; cried the priest, &lsquo;convince her of our
      nothingness! Tell her that we are but dust, rottenness, and damnation! Ah!
      suffer that I may hide my head in a hair-cloth and rest it against Thy
      feet and stay there, motionless, until I rot away in death. The earth will
      no longer exist for me. The sun will no longer shine. I shall see nothing
      more, feel nothing, hear nothing. Nought of all this wretched world will
      come to turn my soul from its adoration of Thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gradually becoming more and more excited, and he stepped towards
      Albine with upraised hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said rightly. It is Death that is present here; Death that is before
      my eyes; Death that delivers and saves one from all rottenness. Hear me! I
      renounce, I deny life, I wholly refuse it, I spit upon it. Those flowers
      of yours stink; your sun dazzles and blinds; your grass makes lepers of
      those that lie upon it; your garden is but a charnel-place where all rots
      and putrefies. The earth reeks with abomination. You lie when you talk of
      love and light and gladsome life in the depths of your palace of greenery.
      There is nought but darkness there. Those trees of yours exhale a poison
      which transforms men into beasts; your thickets are charged with the venom
      of vipers; your streams carry pestilence in their blue waters. If I could
      snatch away from that world of nature, which you extol, its kirtle of
      sunshine and its girdle of greenery, you would see it hideous like a very
      fury, a skeleton, rotting away with disease and vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And even if you spoke the truth, even if your hands were really filled
      with pleasures, even if you should carry me to a couch of roses and offer
      me the dreams of Paradise, I would defend myself yet the more desperately
      from your embraces. There is war between us; war eternal and implacable.
      See! the church is very small; it is poverty-stricken; it is ugly; its
      confessional-box and pulpit are made of common deal, its font is merely of
      plaster, its altars are formed of four boards which I have painted myself.
      But what of that? It is yet vaster than your garden, greater than the
      valley, greater, even, than the whole earth. It is an impregnable fortress
      which nothing can ever break down. The winds, the sun, the forests, the
      ocean, all that is, may combine to assault it; yet it will stand erect and
      unshaken for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, let all the jungles tower aloft and assail the walls with their
      thorny arms, let all the legions of insects swarm out of their holes in
      the ground and gnaw at the walls; the church, ruinous though it may seem,
      will never fall before the invasion of life. It is Death, Death the
      inexpugnable!... And do you know what will one day happen? The tiny church
      will grow and spread to such a colossal size, and will cast around such a
      mighty shadow, that all that nature, you speak of, will give up the ghost.
      Ah! Death, the Death of everything, with the skies gaping to receive our
      souls, above the curse-stricken ruins of the world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he shouted those last words, he pushed Albine forcibly towards the
      door. She, extremely pale, retreated step by step. When he had finished in
      a gasping voice she very gravely answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all over, then? You drive me away? Yet, I am your wife. It is you
      who made me so. And God, since He permitted it, cannot punish us to such a
      point as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now on the threshold, and she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen! Every day, at sunset, I go to the end of the garden, to the spot
      where the wall has fallen in. I shall wait for you there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she disappeared. The vestry door fell back with a sound like a
      deep sigh.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The church was perfectly silent, except for the murmuring sound of the
      rain, which was falling heavily once more. In that sudden change to
      quietude the priest&rsquo;s anger subsided, and he even felt moved. It was with
      his face streaming with tears, his frame shaken by sobs, that he went back
      to throw himself on his knees before the great crucifix. A torrent of
      ardent thanksgiving burst from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks be to Thee, O God, for the help which Thou hast graciously
      bestowed upon me. Without Thy grace I should have hearkened unto the
      promptings of my flesh, and should have miserably returned to my sin. It
      was Thy grace that girded my loins as with armour for battle; Thy grace
      was indeed my armour, my courage, the support of my soul, that kept me
      erect, beyond weakness. Oh! my God, Thou wert in me; it was Thy voice that
      spoke in me, for I no longer felt the cowardice of the flesh, I could have
      cut asunder my very heart-strings. And now, O God, I offer Thee my
      bleeding heart. It no longer belongs to any creature of this world; it is
      Thine alone. To give it to Thee I have wrenched it from all worldly
      affection. But think not, O God, that I take any pride to myself for this
      victory. I know that without Thee I am nothing; and I humbly cast myself
      at Thy feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank down upon the altar steps, unable to utter another word, while his
      breath panted incense-like from his parted lips. The divine grace bathed
      him in ineffable ecstasy. He sought Jesus in the recesses of his being, in
      that sanctuary of love which he was ever preparing for His worthy
      reception. And Jesus was now present there. The Abbe knew it by the sweet
      influences which permeated him. And thereupon he joined with Jesus in that
      spiritual converse which at times bore him away from earth to
      companionship with God. He sighed out the verse from the &lsquo;Song of
      Solomon,&rsquo; &lsquo;My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth his flock among
      the lilies, until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away.&rsquo; He pondered
      over the words of the &lsquo;Imitation:&rsquo; &lsquo;It is a great art to know how to talk
      with Jesus, and it requires much prudence to keep Him near one.&rsquo; And then,
      with adorable condescension, Jesus came down to him, and spoke with him
      for hours of his needs, his happiness, and his hopes. Their confidences
      were not less affectionate and touching than those of two friends, who
      meet after long separation and quietly retire to converse on the bank of
      some lonely stream; for during those hours of divine condescension Jesus
      deigned to be his friend, his best, most faithful friend, one who never
      forsook him, and who in return for a little love gave him all the
      treasures of eternal life. That day the priest was eager to prolong the
      sweet converse, and indeed, when six o&rsquo;clock sounded through the quiet
      church, he was still listening to the words which echoed through his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his side there was unreserved confession, unimpeded by the restraints
      of language, natural effusion of the heart which spoke even more quickly
      than the mind. Abbe Mouret told everything to Jesus, as to a God who had
      come down in all the intimacy of the most loving tenderness, and who would
      listen to everything. He confessed that he still loved Albine; and he was
      surprised that he had been able to speak sternly to her and drive her
      away, without his whole being breaking out into revolt. He marvelled at
      it, and smiled as though it were some wonderful miracle performed by
      another. And Jesus told him that he must not be astonished, and that the
      greatest saints were often but unconscious instruments in the hands of
      God. Then the Abbe gave expression to a doubt. Had he not lost merit in
      seeking refuge in the Cross and even in the Passion of his Saviour? Had he
      not shown that he possessed as yet but little courage, since he had not
      dared to fight unaided? But Jesus evinced kindly tolerance, and answered
      that man&rsquo;s weakness was God&rsquo;s continual care, and that He especially loved
      those suffering souls, to whose assistance He went, like a friend to the
      bedside of a sick companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it a sin to love Albine, a sin for which he, Serge, would be
      damned? No; if his love was clean of all fleshly taint, and added another
      hope to his desire for eternal life. But, then, how was he to love her? In
      silence; without speaking a word to her, without taking a step towards
      her; simply allowing his pure affection to breathe forth, like a sweet
      perfume, pleasing unto heaven. And Jesus smiled with increasing
      kindliness, drawing nearer as if to encourage confession, in such wise
      that the priest grew bolder and began to recapitulate Albine&rsquo;s charms. She
      had hair that was fair and golden as an angel&rsquo;s; she was very white, with
      big soft eyes, like those of the aureoled saints. Jesus seemed to listen
      to this in silence, though a smile still played upon His face. And the
      priest continued: She had grown much taller. She was now like a queen,
      with rounded form and splendid shoulders. Oh! to clasp her waist, were it
      only for a second, and to feel her shoulders drawn close by his embrace!
      But the smile on the divine countenance then paled and died away, as a
      star sinks and falls beneath the horizon. Abbe Mouret now spoke all alone.
      Ah! had he not shown himself too hard-hearted? Why had he driven her away
      without one single word of affection, since Heaven allowed him to love
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do love her! I do love her!&rsquo; he cried aloud, in a distracted voice,
      that rang through the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he saw her still standing there. She was stretching out her
      arms to him; she was beautiful enough to make him break all his vows. He
      threw himself upon her bosom without thought of the reverence due to his
      surroundings, he clasped her and rained kisses upon her face. It was
      before her that he now knelt, imploring her mercy, and beseeching her to
      forgive him his unkindness. He told her that, at times a voice which was
      not his own spoke through his lips. Could he himself ever have treated her
      harshly? It was the strange voice that had repulsed her. It could not,
      surely, be he himself, for he would have been unable to touch a hair of
      her head without loving emotion. And yet he had driven her away. The
      church was really empty! Whither should he hasten to find her again, to
      bring her back, and wipe her tears away with kisses? The rain was
      streaming down more violently than ever. The roads must be rivers of mud.
      He pictured her to himself lashed by the downpour, tottering alongside the
      ditches, her clothes soaked and clinging to her skin. No! no! it could not
      have been himself; it was that other voice, the jealous voice that had so
      cruelly sought to slay his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Jesus!&rsquo; he cried in desperation, &lsquo;be merciful and give her back to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But his Lord was no longer there. Then Abbe Mouret, awaking with a start,
      turned horribly pale. He understood it all. He had not known how to keep
      Jesus with him. He had lost his friend, and had been left defenceless
      against the powers of evil. Instead of that inward light, which had shone
      so brightly within him as he received his God, he now found utter
      darkness, a foul vapour that irritated his senses. Jesus had withdrawn His
      grace on leaving him; and he, who since early morning had been so strong
      with heaven-sent help, now felt utterly miserable, forsaken, weak and
      helpless as an infant. How frightful was his fall! How galling its
      bitterness! To have straggled so heroically, to have remained unshaken,
      invincible, implacable, while the temptress actually stood before him,
      with all her warm life, her swelling bosom and superb shoulders, her
      perfume of love and passion; and then to fall so shamefully, to throb with
      desire, when she had disappeared, leaving behind her but the echo of her
      skirts, and the fragrance diffused from her white neck! Now, these mere
      recollections sufficed to make her all powerful, her influence permeated
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jesus! Jesus!&rsquo; cried the priest, once more, &lsquo;return, come back to me;
      speak to me once again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jesus remained deaf to his cry. For a moment Abbe Mouret raised his
      arms to heaven in desperate entreaty. His shoulders cracked and strained
      beneath the wild violence of his supplications. But soon his hands fell
      down again in discouragement. Heaven preserved that hopeless silence which
      suppliants at times encounter. Then he once more sat down on the altar
      steps, heart-crushed and with ashen face, pressing his elbows to his
      sides, as though he were trying to reduce his flesh to the smallest
      proportions possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God! Thou deserted me!&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;Nevertheless, Thy will be done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke not another word, but sat there, panting breathlessly, like a
      hunted beast that cowers motionless in fear of the hounds. Ever since his
      sin, he had thus seemed to be the sport of the divine grace. It denied
      itself to his most ardent prayers; it poured down upon him, unexpectedly
      and refreshingly, when he had lost all hope of winning it for long years
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he had been inclined to rebel against this dispensation of
      Heaven, complaining like a betrayed lover, and demanding the immediate
      return of that consoling grace, whose kiss made him so strong. But
      afterwards, after unavailing outbursts of anger, he had learned to
      understand that humility profited him most and could alone enable him to
      endure the withdrawal of the divine assistance. Then, for hours and for
      days, he would humble himself and wait for comfort which came not. In vain
      he cast himself unreservedly into the hands of God, annihilated himself
      before the Divinity, wearied himself with the incessant repetition of
      prayers. He could not perceive God&rsquo;s presence with him; and his flesh,
      breaking free from all restraint, rose up in rebellious desire. It was a
      slow agony of temptation, in which the weapons of faith fell, one by one,
      from his faltering hands, in which he lay inert in the clutch of passion,
      in which he beheld with horror his own ignominy, without having the
      courage to raise his little finger to free himself from the thraldom of
      sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was now his life. He had felt sin&rsquo;s attacks in every form. Not a day
      passed that he was not tried. Sin assumed a thousand guises, assailed him
      through his eyes and ears, flew boldly at his throat, leaped treacherously
      upon his shoulders, or stole torturingly into his bones. His transgression
      was ever present, he almost always beheld Albine dazzling as the sunshine,
      lighting up the greenery of the Paradou. He only ceased to see her in
      those rare moments when the divine grace deigned to close his eyes with
      its cool caresses. And he strove to hide his sufferings as one hides those
      of some disgraceful disease. He wrapped himself in the endless silence,
      which no one knew how to make him break, filling the parsonage with his
      martyrdom and resignation, and exasperating La Teuse, who, at times, when
      his back was turned, would shake her fist at heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was alone now, and need take no care to hide his torment. Sin
      had just struck him such an overwhelming blow, that he had not strength
      left to move from the altar steps, where he had fallen. He remained there,
      sighing, and groaning, parched with agony, incapable of a single tear. And
      he thought of the calm unruffled life that had once been his. Ah! the
      perfect peace, the full confidence of his first days at Les Artaud! The
      path of salvation had seemed so straight and easy then! He had smiled at
      the very mention of temptation. He had lived in the midst of wickedness,
      without knowledge of it, without fear of it, certain of being able to
      withstand it. He had been a model priest, so pure and chaste, so
      inexperienced and innocent in God&rsquo;s sight, that God had led him by the
      hand like a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, all that childlike innocence was dead, God visited him in the
      morning, and forthwith tried him. A state of temptation became his life on
      earth. Now that full manhood and sin had come upon him, he entered into
      the everlasting struggle. Could it be that God really loved him more now
      than before? The great saints have all left fragments of their torn flesh
      upon the thorns of the way of sorrow. He tried to gather some consolation
      from this circumstance. At each laceration of his flesh, each racking of
      his bones, he tried to assure himself of some exceeding great reward. And
      then, no infliction that Heaven might now cast upon him could be too
      heavy. He even looked back with scorn on his former serenity, his easy
      fervour, which had set him on his knees with mere girlish enthusiasm, and
      left him unconscious even of the bruising of the hard stones. He strove
      also to discover pleasure in pain, in plunging into it, annihilating
      himself in it. But, even while he poured out thanks to God, his teeth
      chattered with growing terror, and the voice of his rebellious blood cried
      out to him that this was all falsehood, and that the only happiness worth
      desiring was in Albine&rsquo;s arms, amongst the flowers of the Paradou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had put aside Mary for Jesus, sacrificing his heart that he might
      subdue his flesh, and hoping to implant some virility in his faith. Mary
      disquieted him too much, with her smoothly braided hair, her outstretched
      hands, and her womanly smile. He could never kneel before her without
      dropping his eyes, for fear of catching sight of the hem of her dress.
      Then, too, he accused her of having treated him too tenderly in former
      times. She had kept him sheltered so long within the folds of her robe,
      that he had let himself slip from her arms to those of a human creature
      without being conscious even of the change of his affection. He thought of
      all the roughness of Brother Archangias, of his refusal to worship Mary,
      of the distrustful glances with which he had seemed to watch her. He
      himself despaired of ever rising to such a height of roughness, and so he
      simply left her, hiding her images and deserting her altar. Yet she
      remained in his heart, like some love which, though unavowed, is ever
      present. Sin, with sacrilege whose very horror made him shudder, made use
      of her to tempt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever he still invoked her, as he did at times of irrepressible
      emotion, it was Albine who showed herself beneath the white veil, with the
      blue scarf knotted round her waist and the golden roses blooming on her
      bare feet. All the representations of the Virgin, the Virgin with the
      royal mantle of cloth-of-gold, the Virgin crowned with stars, the Virgin
      visited by the Angel of the Annunciation, the peaceful Virgin poised
      between a lily and a distaff, all brought him some memory of Albine, her
      smiling eyes or her delicately curved mouth or her softly rounded cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, by a supreme effort, he drove the female element from his
      worship, and sought refuge in Jesus, though even His gentle mildness
      sometimes proved a source of disquietude to him. What he needed was a
      jealous God, an implacable God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, girded
      with thunder and manifesting Himself only to chastise the terrified world.
      He had done with the saints and the angels and the Divine Mother; he bowed
      down before God Himself alone, the omnipotent Master, who demanded from
      him his every breath. And he felt the hand of this God laid heavily upon
      him, holding him helpless at His mercy through space and time, like a
      guilty atom. Ah! to be nothing, to be damned, to dream of hell, to wrestle
      vainly against hideous temptations, all that was surely good.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Jesus he took but the cross. He was seized with that passion for the
      cross which has made so many lips press themselves again and again to the
      crucifix till they were worn away with kissing. He took up the cross and
      followed Jesus. He sought to make it heavier, the mightiest of burdens; it
      was great joy to him to fall beneath its weight, to drag it on his knees,
      his back half broken. In it he beheld the only source of strength for the
      soul, of joy for the mind, of the consummation of virtue and the
      perfection of holiness. In it lay all that was good; all ended in death
      upon it. To suffer and to die, those words ever sounded in his ears, as
      the end and goal of mortal wisdom. And, when he had fastened himself to
      the cross, he enjoyed the boundless consolation of God&rsquo;s love. It was no
      longer, now, upon Mary that he lavished filial tenderness or lover&rsquo;s
      passion. He loved for love&rsquo;s mere sake, with an absolute abstract love. He
      loved God with a love that lifted him out of himself, out of all else, and
      wrapped him round with a dazzling radiance of glory. He was like a torch
      that burns away with blazing light. And death seemed to him to be only a
      great impulse of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what had he omitted to do that he was thus so sorely tried? With his
      hand he wiped away the perspiration that streamed down his brow, and
      reflected that, that very morning, he had made his usual self-examination
      without finding any great guilt within him. Was he not leading a life of
      great austerity and mortification of the flesh? Did he not love God solely
      and blindly? Ah! how he would have blessed His Holy Name had He only
      restored him his peace, deeming him now sufficiently punished for his
      transgression! But, perhaps, that sin of his could never be expiated. And
      then, in spite of himself, his mind reverted to Albine and the Paradou,
      and all their memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he tried to make excuses for himself. He had fallen, one evening,
      senseless upon the tiled floor of his bedroom, stricken with brain fever.
      For three weeks he had remained unconscious. His blood surged furiously
      through his veins and raged within him like a torrent that had burst its
      banks. His whole body, from the crown of his head to the soles of his
      feet, was so scoured and renewed and wrought afresh by the mighty
      labouring of his ailment, that in his delirium he had sometimes thought he
      could hear the very hammer blows of workmen that nailed his bones together
      again. Then, one morning, he had awakened, feeling like a new being. He
      was born a second time, freed of all that his five-and-twenty years of
      life had successively implanted in him. His childish piety, his education
      at the seminary, the faith of his early priesthood, had all vanished, had
      been carried off, and their place was bare and empty. In truth, it could
      be hell alone that had thus prepared him for the reception of evil,
      disarming him of all his former weapons, and reducing his body to languor
      and softness, through which sin might readily enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, perfectly unconscious of it all, unknowingly surrendered himself to
      the gradual approach of evil. When he had reopened his eyes in the
      Paradou, he had felt himself an infant once more, with no memory of the
      past, no knowledge of his priesthood. He experienced a gentle pleasure, a
      glad feeling of surprise at thus beginning life afresh, as though it were
      all new and strange to him and would be delightful to learn. Oh! the sweet
      apprenticeship, the charming observations, the delicious discoveries! That
      Paradou was a vast abode of felicity; and hell, in placing him there, had
      known full well that he would be defenceless. Never, in his first youth,
      had he known such enjoyment in growing. That first youth of his, when he
      now thought of it, seemed quite black and gloomy, graceless, wan and
      inactive, as if it had been spent far away from the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the Paradou, how joyfully had he hailed the sun! How admiringly had
      he gazed at the first tree, at the first flower, at the tiniest insect he
      had seen, at the most insignificant pebble he had picked up! The very
      stones charmed him. The horizon was a source of never-ending amazement.
      One clear morning, the memory of which still filled his eyes, bringing
      back a perfume of jasmine, a lark&rsquo;s clear song, he had been so affected by
      emotion that he felt all power desert his limbs. He had long found
      pleasure in learning the sensations of life. And, ah! the morning when
      Albine had been born beside him amidst the roses! As he thought of it, an
      ecstatic smile broke out upon his face. She rose up like a star that was
      necessary to the very sun&rsquo;s existence. She illumined everything, she made
      everything clear. She made his life complete.

    <p>
      Then in fancy he once again walked with her through the Paradou. He
      remembered the little curls that waved behind her neck as she ran on
      before him. She exhaled delicious scent, and the touch of her warm swaying
      skirts seemed like a caress. And when she clasped him with her supple
      curving arms, he half expected to see her, so slight and slender she was,
      twine herself around him. It was she who went foremost. She led him
      through winding paths, where they loitered, that their walk might last the
      longer. It was she who instilled into him love for nature; and it was by
      watching the loves of the plants that he had learned to love her, with a
      love that was long, indeed, in bursting into life, but whose sweetness had
      been theirs at last. Beneath the shade of the giant tree they had reached
      their journey&rsquo;s goal. Oh! to clasp her once again&mdash;yet once again!
    </p>
    <p>
      A low groan suddenly came from the priest. He hastily sprang up and then
      flung himself down again. Temptation had just assailed him afresh. Into
      what paths were his recollections leading him? Did he not know, only too
      well, that Satan avails himself of every wile to insinuate his
      serpent-head into the soul, even when it is absorbed in self-examination?
      No! no! he had no excuse. His illness had in no wise authorised him to
      sin. He should have set strict guard upon himself, and have sought God
      anew upon recovering from his fever. And what a frightful proof he now had
      of his vileness: he was not even able to make calm confession of his sin.
      Would he never be able to silence his nature? He wildly thought of
      scooping his brains out of his skull that he might be able to think no
      more, and of opening his veins that his blood might no longer torment him.
      For a moment he buried his face within his hands, shuddering as though the
      beasts that he felt prowling around him might infect him with the hot
      breath of temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his thoughts strayed on in spite of himself, and his blood throbbed
      wildly in his very heart. Though he held his clenched fists to his eyes,
      he still saw Albine, dazzling like a sun. Every effort that he made to
      press the vision from his sight only made her shine out before him with
      increased brilliancy. Was God, then, utterly forsaking him, that he could
      find no refuge from temptation? And, in spite of all his efforts to
      control his thoughts, he espied every tiny blade of grass that thrust
      itself up by Albine&rsquo;s skirts; he saw a little thistle-flower fastened in
      her hair, against which he remembered that he had pricked his lips. Even
      the perfumed atmosphere of the Paradou floated round him, and
      well-remembered sounds came back, the repeated call of a bird, then an
      interval of hushed silence, then a sigh floating through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did not Heaven at once strike him dead with its lightning? That would
      have been less cruel. It was with a voluptuous pang, like the pangs which
      assail the damned, that he recalled his transgression. He shuddered when
      he again heard in his heart the abominable words that he had spoken at
      Albine&rsquo;s feet. Their echoes were now accusing him before the throne of
      God. He had acknowledged Woman as his sovereign. He had yielded to her as
      a slave, kissing her feet, longing to be the water she drank and the bread
      she ate. He began to understand now why he could no longer recover
      self-control. God had given him over to Woman. But he would chastise her,
      scourge her, break her very limbs to force her to let him go! It was she
      who was the slave; she, the creature of impurity, to whom the Church
      should have denied a soul. Then he braced himself, and shook his fists at
      the vision of Albine; but his fists opened and his hands glided along her
      shoulders in a loving caress, while his lips, just now breathing out anger
      and insult, pressed themselves to her hair, stammering forth words of
      adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret opened his eyes again. The burning apparition of Albine
      vanished. It was sudden and unexpected solace. He was able to weep. Tears
      flowed slowly and refreshingly down his cheeks, and he drew a long breath,
      still fearing to move, lest the Evil One should again grip him by the
      neck, for he yet thought that he heard the snarl of a beast behind him.
      And then he found such pleasure in the cessation of his sufferings that
      his one thought was to prolong the enjoyment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the rain had ceased falling. The sun was setting in a vast crimson
      glow, which spread across the windows like curtains of rose-coloured
      satin. The church was quite warm and bright in the parting breath of the
      sinking luminary. The priest thanked God for the respite He had been
      pleased to vouchsafe to him. A broad ray of light, like a beam of
      gold-dust, streamed through the nave and illumined the far end of the
      building, the clock, the pulpit, and the high altar. Perhaps the Divine
      grace was returning to him from heaven along that radiant path. He watched
      with interest the atoms that came and went with prodigious speed through
      the ray, like a swarm of busy messengers ever hastening with news from the
      sun to the earth. A thousand lighted candles would not have filled the
      church with such splendour. Curtains of cloth-of-gold seemed to hang
      behind the high altar; treasures of the goldsmith&rsquo;s art covered all the
      ledges; candle-holders arose in dazzling sheaves; censers glowed full of
      burning gems; sacred vases gleamed like fiery comets; and around all there
      seemed to be a rain of luminous flowers amidst waving lacework&mdash;beds,
      bouquets, and garlands of roses, from whose expanding petals dropped
      showers of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Abbe Mouret desired such magnificence for his poor church. He
      smiled, and dreamt of how he might retain all that splendour there, and
      then arrange it most effectively. He would have preferred to see the
      curtains of cloth-of-gold hung rather higher; the vases, too, needed more
      careful arrangement; and he thought that the bouquets of flowers might be
      tied up more neatly, and the garlands be more regularly shaped. Yet how
      wondrously magnificent it all was! He was the pontiff of a church of gold.
      Bishops, princes, princesses, arrayed in royal mantles, multitudes of
      believers, bending to the ground, were coming to visit it, encamping in
      the valley, waiting for weeks at the door until they should be able to
      enter. They kissed his feet, for even his feet had turned to gold, and
      worked miracles. The bath of gold mounted to his knees. A golden heart was
      beating within his golden breast, with so clear a musical pulsation that
      the waiting crowds could hear it from outside. Then a feeling of
      overweening pride seized upon him. He was an idol. The golden beam mounted
      still higher, the high altar was all ablaze with glory, and the priest
      grew certain that the Divine grace must be returning to him, such was his
      inward satisfaction. The fierce snarl behind him had now grown gentle and
      coaxing, and he only felt on his shoulder a soft velvety pressure, as
      though some giant cat were lightly caressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still pursued his reverie. Never before had he seen things under such a
      favourable light. Everything seemed quite easy to him now that he once
      more felt full of strength. Since Albine was waiting for him, he would go
      and join her. It was only natural. On the previous morning he had married
      Fortune and Rosalie. The Church did not forbid marriages. He saw that
      young couple again as they knelt before him, smiling and nudging each
      other while his hands were held over them in benediction. Then, in the
      evening, they had shown him their room. Each word that he had spoken to
      them echoed loudly in his ear. He had told Fortune that God had sent him a
      companion, because He did not wish man to live alone; and he had told
      Rosalie that she must cleave to her husband, never leaving him, but always
      acting as his obedient helpmate. But he had said these things also for
      Albine and himself. Was she not his companion, his obedient helpmate, whom
      God had sent to him that his manhood might not wither up in solitude?
      Besides, they had been joined the one to the other. He felt surprised that
      he had not understood and recognised it at once; that he had not gone away
      with her, as his duty plainly required that he should have done. But he
      had quite made up his mind now; he would certainly join her in the
      morning. He could be with her in half an hour. He would go through the
      village, and take the road up the hill; it was much the shortest way. He
      could do what he pleased; he was the master, and no one would presume to
      say anything to him. If any one looked at him, a wave of his hand would
      force them to bend their heads. He would live with Albine. He would call
      her his wife. They would be very happy together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden stream mounted still higher, and played amongst his fingers.
      Again did he seem to be immersed in a bath of gold. He would take the
      altar-vases away to ornament his house, he would keep up a fine
      establishment, he would pay his servants with fragments of chalices which
      he could easily break with his fingers. He would hang his bridal-bed with
      the cloth-of-gold that draped the altar; and he would give his wife for
      jewels the golden hearts and chaplets and crosses that hung from the necks
      of the Virgin and the saints. The church itself, if another storey were
      added to it, would supply them with a palace. God would have no objection
      to make since He had allowed them to love each other. And, besides, was it
      not he who was now God, with the people kissing his golden miracle-working
      feet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret rose. He made that sweeping gesture of Jeanbernat&rsquo;s, that wide
      gesture of negation, that took in everything as far as the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing, nothing, nothing!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;God does not exist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty shudder seemed to sweep through the church. The terrified priest
      turned deadly pale and listened. Who had spoken? Who was it that had
      blasphemed? Suddenly the velvety caress, whose gentle pressure he had felt
      upon his shoulder, turned fierce and savage: sharp talons seemed to be
      rending his flesh, and once more he felt his blood streaming forth. Yet he
      remained on his feet, struggling against the sudden attack. He cursed and
      reviled the triumphant sin that sniggered and grinned round his temples,
      whilst all the hammers of the Evil One battered at them. Why had he not
      been on his guard against Satan&rsquo;s wiles? Did he not know full well that it
      was his habit to glide up softly with gentle paws that he might drive them
      like blades into the very vitals of his victim?
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger increased as he thought how he had been entrapped, like a mere
      child. Was he destined, then, to be ever hurled to the ground, with sin
      crouching victoriously on his breast? This time he had actually denied his
      God. It was all one fatal descent. His transgression had destroyed his
      faith, and then dogma had tottered. One single doubt of the flesh,
      pleading abomination, sufficed to sweep heaven away. The divine ordinances
      irritated one; the divine mysteries made one smile. Then came other
      temptations and allurements; gold, power, unrestrained liberty, an
      irresistible longing for enjoyment, culminating in luxuriousness,
      sprawling on a bed of wealth and pride. And then God was robbed. His
      vessels were broken to adorn woman&rsquo;s impurity. Ah! well, then, he was
      damned. Nothing could make any difference to him now. Sin might speak
      aloud. It was useless to struggle further. The monsters who had hovered
      about his neck were battening on his vitals now. He yielded to them with
      hideous satisfaction. He shook his fists at the church. No; he believed no
      longer in the divinity of Christ; he believed no longer in the Holy
      Trinity; he believed in naught but himself, and his muscles and the
      appetites of his body. He wanted to live. He felt the necessity of being a
      man. Oh! to speed along through the open air, to be lusty and strong, to
      owe obedience to no jealous master, to fell one&rsquo;s enemies with stones, to
      carry off the fair maidens that passed upon one&rsquo;s shoulders. He would
      break out from that living tomb where cruel hands had thrust him. He would
      awaken his manhood, which had only been slumbering. And might he die of
      shame if he should find that it were really dead! And might the Divinity
      be accursed if, by the touch of His finger, He had made him different from
      the rest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest stood erect, his mind all dazed and scared. He fancied that, at
      this fresh outburst of blasphemy, the church was falling down upon him.
      The sunlight, which had poured over the high altar, had gradually spread
      and mounted the walls like ruddy fire. Flames soared and licked the
      rafters, then died away in a sanguineous, ember-like glow. And all at once
      the church became quite black. It was as though the fires of the setting
      sun had burst the roof asunder, pierced the walls, thrown open wide
      breaches on every side to some exterior foe. The gloomy framework seemed
      to shake beneath some violent assault. Night was coming on quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the far distance, the priest heard a gentle murmur rising from
      the valley of Les Artaud. The time had been when he had not understood the
      impassioned language of those burning lands, where writhed but knotted
      vine-stocks, withered almond-trees, and decrepit olives sprawling with
      crippled limbs. Protected by his ignorance, he had passed undisturbed
      through all that world of passion. But, to-day, his ear detected the
      slightest sigh of the leaves that lay panting in the heat. Afar off, on
      the edge of the horizon, the hills, still hot with the sinking luminary&rsquo;s
      farewell, seemed to set themselves in motion with the tramp of an army on
      the march. Nearer at hand, the scattered rocks, the stones along the road,
      all the pebbles in the valley, throbbed and rolled as if possessed by a
      craving for motion. Then the tracts of ruddy soil, the few fields that had
      been reduced to cultivation, seemed to heave and growl like rivers that
      had burst their banks, bearing along in a blood-like flood the
      engenderings of seeds, the births of roots, the embraces of plants. Soon
      everything was in motion. The vine-branches appeared to crawl along like
      huge insects; the parched corn and the dry grass formed into dense,
      lance-waving battalions; the trees stretched out their boughs like
      wrestlers making ready for a contest; the fallen leaves skipped forward;
      the very dust on the road rolled on. It was a moving multitude reinforced
      by fresh recruits at every step; a legion, the sound of whose coming went
      on in front of it; an outburst of passionate life, sweeping everything
      along in a mighty whirlwind of fruitfulness. And all at once the assault
      began. From the limits of the horizon, the whole countryside, the hills
      and stones and fields and trees, rushed upon the church. At the first
      shock, the building quivered and cracked. The walls were pierced and the
      tiles on the roof were thrown down. But the great Christ, although shaken,
      did not fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short respite followed. Outside, the voices sounded more angrily, and
      the priest could now distinguish human ones amongst them. The Artauds,
      those bastards who sprang up out of the rocky soil with the persistence of
      brambles, were now in their turn blowing a blast that reeked of teeming
      life. They had planted everywhere forests of humanity that swallowed up
      all around them. They came up to the church, they shattered the door with
      a push, and threatened to block up the very nave with the invading scions
      of their race. Behind them came the beasts; the oxen that tried to batter
      down the walls with their horns, the flocks of asses, goats, and sheep,
      that dashed against the ruined church like living waves, while swarms of
      wood-lice and crickets attacked the foundations and reduced them to dust
      with their sawlike teeth. Yet again, on the other side, there was
      Desiree&rsquo;s poultry-yard, where the dunghill reeked with suffocating fumes.
      Here the big cock, Alexander, sounded the assault, and the hens loosened
      the stones with their beaks, and the rabbits burrowed under the very
      altars; whilst the pig, too fat to stir, grunted and waited till all the
      sacred ornaments should be reduced to warm ashes in which he might wallow
      at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great roar ascended, and a second assault was delivered. The villagers,
      the animals, all that overflowing sea of life assailed the church with
      such impetuosity that the rafters bent and curved. This time a part of the
      walls tottered and fell down, the ceiling shook, the woodwork of the
      windows was carried away, and the grey mist of the evening streamed in
      through the frightful gaping breaches. The great Christ now only clung to
      His cross by the nail that pierced His left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty shout hailed the downfall of the block of wall. Yet the church
      still stood there firmly, in spite of the injuries it had received. It
      offered a stern, silent, unflinching resistance, clutching desperately to
      the tiniest stones of its foundations. It seemed as though, to keep itself
      from falling, it required only the support of its slenderest pillar,
      which, by some miracle of equilibration, held up the gaping roof. Then
      Abbe Mouret beheld the rude plants of the plateau, the dreadful-looking
      growths that had become hard as iron amidst the arid rocks, that were
      knotted like snakes and bossy with muscles, set themselves to work. The
      rust-hued lichens gnawed away at the rough plasterwork like fiery leprosy.
      Then the thyme-plants thrust their roots between the bricks like so many
      iron wedges. The lavenders insinuated hooked fingers into the loosened
      stonework, and by slow persistent efforts tore the blocks asunder. The
      junipers, the rosemaries, the prickly holly bushes, climbed higher and
      battered the walls with irresistible blows; and even the grass, the grass
      whose dry blades slipped beneath the great door, stiffened itself into
      steel-like spears and made its way down the nave, where it forced up the
      flagstones with powerful levers. It was a victorious revolt, it was
      revolutionary nature constructing barricades out of the overturned altars,
      and wrecking the church which had for centuries cast too deep a shadow
      over it. The other combatants had fallen back, and let the plants, the
      thyme and the lavender and the lichens, complete the overthrow of the
      building with their ceaseless little blows, their constant gnawing, which
      proved more destructive than the heavier onslaught of the stronger
      assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, the end came. The rowan-tree, whose topmost branches had
      already forced their way through the broken windows under the vaulted
      roof, rushed in violently with its formidable stream of greenery. It
      planted itself in the centre of the nave and grew there monstrously. Its
      trunk expanded till its girth became so colossal that it seemed as though
      it would burst the church asunder like a girdle spanning it too closely.
      Its branches shot out in knotted arms, each one of which broke down a
      piece of the wall or thrust off a strip of the roof, and they went on
      multiplying without cessation, each branch ramifying, till a fresh tree
      sprang out of each single knot, with such impetuosity of growth that the
      ruins of the church, pierced through and through like a sieve, flew into
      fragments, scattering a fine dust to the four quarters of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the giant tree seemed to reach the stars; its forest of branches was a
      forest of legs, arms, and breasts full of sap; the long locks of women
      streamed down from it; men&rsquo;s heads burst out from the bark; and up aloft
      pairs of lovers, lying languid by the edges of their nests, filled the air
      with the music of their delights.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final blast of the storm which had broken over the church swept away the
      dust of its remains: the pulpit and the confessional-box, which had been
      ground into powder, the lacerated holy pictures, the shattered sacred
      vessels, all the litter at which the legion of sparrows that had once
      dwelt amongst the tiles was eagerly pecking. The great Christ, torn from
      the cross, hung for a moment from one of the streaming women&rsquo;s curls, and
      then was whirled away into the black darkness, in the depths of which it
      sank with a loud crash. The Tree of Life had pierced the heavens; it
      overtopped the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret was filled with the mad joy of an accursed spirit at the sight
      before him. The church was vanquished; God no longer had a house. And
      thenceforward God could no longer trouble him. He was free to rejoin
      Albine, since it was she who triumphed. He laughed at himself for having
      declared, an hour previously, that the church would swallow up the whole
      earth with its shadow. The earth, indeed, had avenged itself by consuming
      the church. The mad laughter into which he broke had the effect of
      suddenly awakening him from his hallucination. He gazed stupidly round the
      nave, which the evening shadows were slowly darkening. Through the windows
      he could see patches of star-spangled sky; and he was about to stretch out
      his arms to feel the walls, when he heard Desiree calling to him from the
      vestry-passage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge! Are you there? Why don&rsquo;t you answer? I have been looking
      for you for this last half-hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in; she was holding a lighted lamp; and the priest then saw that
      the church was still standing. He could no longer understand anything, but
      remained in a horrible state of doubt betwixt the unconquerable church,
      springing up again from its ashes, and Albine, the all-powerful, who could
      shake the very throne of God by a single breath.

      Desiree came up to him, full of merry chatter.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you there? Are you there?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Why are you playing at
      hide-and-seek? I called out to you at the top of my voice at least a dozen
      times. I thought you must have gone out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pried into all the gloomy corners with an inquisitive glance, and even
      stepped up to the confessional-box, as though she had expected to surprise
      some one hiding there. Then she came back to Serge, disappointed, and
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you are quite alone? Have you been asleep? What amusement do you find
      in shutting yourself up all alone in the dark? Come along; it is time we
      went to dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe drew his feverish hands across his brow to wipe away the traces
      of the thoughts which he feared were plain for all the world to read. He
      fumbled mechanically at the buttons of his cassock, which seemed to him
      all disarranged. Then he followed his sister with stern-set face and never
      a sign of emotion, stiffened by that priestly energy which throws the
      dignity of sacerdotalism like a veil over the agonies of the flesh.
      Desiree did not even suspect that there was anything the matter with him.
      She simply said as they entered the dining-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had such a good sleep; but you have been talking too much, and
      have made yourself quite pale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, after dinner, Brother Archangias came in to have his game
      of cards with La Teuse. He was in a very merry mood that night; and, when
      the Brother was merry, it was his habit to prod La Teuse in the sides with
      his big fists, an attention which she returned by heartily boxing his
      ears. This skirmishing made them both laugh, with a laughter that shook
      the very ceiling. The Brother, too, when he was in these gay humours,
      would devise all kinds of pranks. He would try to smash plates with his
      nose, and would offer to wager that he could break through the dining-room
      door in battering-ram fashion. He would also empty the snuff out of his
      box into the old servant&rsquo;s coffee, or would thrust a handful of pebbles
      down her neck. The merest trifle would give rise to these noisy outbursts
      of gaiety in the very midst of his wonted surliness. Some little incident,
      at which nobody else laughed, often sufficed to throw him into a state of
      wild hilarity, make him stamp his feet, twirl himself round like a top,
      and hold in his splitting sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it that makes you so gay to-night?&rsquo; La Teuse inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, bestriding a chair and galloping round the table on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! well! go on making a baby of yourself!&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;and,
      my gracious, what a big baby you are! If the Lord is looking at you, He
      must be very well pleased with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother had just slipped off the chair and was lying on the floor,
      with his legs in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does see me, and is pleased to see me as I am. It is His wish that I
      should be gay. When He wishes me to be merry for a time, He rings a bell
      in my body, and then I begin to roll about; and all Paradise smiles as it
      watches me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged himself on his back to the wall, and then, supporting himself
      on the nape of his neck, he hoisted up his body as high as he could and
      began drumming on the wall with his heels. His cassock slipped down and
      exposed to view his black breeches, which were patched at the knees with
      green cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, Monsieur le Cure,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you see how high I can reach with my
      heels. I dare bet that you couldn&rsquo;t do as much. Come! look amused and
      laugh a little. It is better to drag oneself along on one&rsquo;s back than to
      think about a hussy as you are always doing. You know what I mean. For my
      part, when I take to scratching myself I imagine myself to be God&rsquo;s dog,
      and that&rsquo;s what makes me say that all Paradise looks out of the windows to
      smile at me. You might just as well laugh too, Monsieur le Cure. It&rsquo;s all
      done for the saints and you. See! here&rsquo;s a turn-over for Saint Joseph;
      here&rsquo;s another for Saint Michael, and another for Saint John, and another
      for Saint Mark, and another for Saint Matthew&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went on, enumerating a whole string of saints, and turning
      somersaults all round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret, who had been sitting in perfect silence, with his hands
      resting on the edge of the table, was at last constrained to smile. As a
      rule, the Brother&rsquo;s sportiveness only disquieted him. La Teuse, as
      Archangias rolled within her reach, kicked at him with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;are we to have our game to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His only reply was a grunt. Then, upon all fours, he sprang towards La
      Teuse as if he meant to bite her. But in lieu thereof he spat upon her
      petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me alone! will you?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;What are you up to now? I begin to
      think you have gone crazy. What it is that amuses you so much I can&rsquo;t
      conceive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What makes me gay is my own affair,&rsquo; he replied, rising to his feet and
      shaking himself. &lsquo;It is not necessary to explain it to you, La Teuse.
      However, as you want a game of cards, let us have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the game began. It was a terrible struggle. The Brother hurled his
      cards upon the table. Whenever he cried out the windows shook sonorously.
      La Teuse at last seemed to be winning. She had secured three aces for some
      time already, and was casting longing eyes at the fourth. But Brother
      Archangias began to indulge in fresh outbursts of gaiety. He pushed up the
      table, at the risk of breaking the lamp. He cheated outrageously, and
      defended himself by means of the most abominable lies, &lsquo;Just for a joke,&rsquo; 
      said he. Then he suddenly began to sing the &lsquo;Vespers,&rsquo; beating time on the
      palm of his left hand with his cards. When his gaiety reached a climax,
      and he could find no adequate means of expressing it, he always took to
      chanting the &lsquo;Vespers,&rsquo; which he repeated for hours at a time. La Teuse,
      who well knew his habits, cried out to him, amidst the bellowing with
      which he shook the room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make a little less noise, do! It is quite distracting. You are much too
      lively to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he set to work on the &lsquo;Complines.&rsquo; Abbe Mouret had now seated himself
      by the window. He appeared to pay no attention to what went on around him,
      apparently neither hearing nor seeing anything of it. At dinner he had
      eaten with his ordinary appetite and had even managed to reply to
      Desiree&rsquo;s everlasting rattle of questions. But now he had given up the
      struggle, his strength at an end, racked, exhausted as he was by the
      internal tempest that still raged within him. He even lacked the courage
      to rise from his seat and go upstairs to his own room. Moreover, he was
      afraid that if he turned his face towards the lamplight, the tears, which
      he could no longer keep from his eyes, would be noticed. So he pressed his
      face close to the window and gazed out into the darkness, growing
      gradually more drowsy, sinking into a kind of nightmare stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias, still busy at his psalm-singing, winked and nodded in
      the direction of the dozing priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked La Teuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother replied by a yet more significant wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what do you mean? Can&rsquo;t you speak? Ah! there&rsquo;s a king. That&rsquo;s
      capital!&mdash;so I take your queen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brother laid down his cards, bent over the table, and whispered close
      to La Teuse&rsquo;s face: &lsquo;That hussy has been here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that well enough,&rsquo; answered La Teuse. &lsquo;I saw her go with
      mademoiselle into the poultry-yard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he gave her a terrible look, and shook his fist in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You saw her, and you let her come in! You ought to have called me, and we
      would have hung her up by the feet to a nail in your kitchen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this the old woman lost her temper, and, lowering her voice solely
      in order that she might not awaken Abbe Mouret, she replied: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go
      talking about hanging people up in my kitchen! I certainly saw her, and I
      even kept my back turned when she went to join his reverence in the church
      when the catechising was over. But all that was no business of mine. I had
      my cooking to attend to! As for the girl herself, I detest her. But if his
      reverence wishes to see her&mdash;why, she is welcome to come whenever she
      pleases. I&rsquo;d let her in myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you were to do that, La Teuse,&rsquo; retorted the Brother ragefully, &lsquo;I
      would strangle you, that I would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any of your nonsense to me, my man! Don&rsquo;t you know that it is
      forbidden you to lay your hands upon a woman, just as it&rsquo;s forbidden for a
      donkey to have anything to do with the <i>Pater Noster</i>? Just you try
      to strangle me and you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;ll do! But do be quiet now, and let
      us finish the game. See, here&rsquo;s another king.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Brother, holding up a card, went on growling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must have come by some road that the devil alone knows for me to have
      missed her to-day. Every afternoon I go and keep guard up yonder by the
      Paradou. If ever I find them together again, I will acquaint the hussy
      with a stout dogwood stick which I have cut expressly for her benefit. And
      I shall keep a watch in the church as well now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He played his card, which La Teuse took with a knave. Then he threw
      himself back in his chair and again burst into one of his loud laughs. He
      did not seem to be able to work himself up into a genuine rage that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; he grumbled, &lsquo;never mind, even if she did see him, she had a
      smacking fall on her nose. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, La Teuse. It was
      raining, you know. I was standing by the school-door when I caught sight
      of her coming down from the church. She was walking along quite straight
      and upright, in her stuck-up fashion, in spite of the pouring rain. But
      when she got into the road, she tumbled down full length, no doubt because
      the ground was so slippery. Oh! how I did laugh! How I did laugh! I
      clapped my hands, too. When she picked herself up again, I saw she was
      bleeding at the wrist. I shall feel happy over it for a week. I cannot
      think of her lying there on the ground without feeling the greatest
      delight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning his attention to the game, he puffed out his cheeks and
      began to chant the <i>De profundis</i>. When he had got to the end of it,
      he began it all over again. The game came to a conclusion in the midst of
      this dirge. It was he who was beaten, but his defeat did not seem to vex
      him in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      When La Teuse had locked the door behind him, after first awakening Abbe
      Mouret, his voice could still be heard, as he went his way through the
      black night, singing the last verse of the psalm, <i>Et ipse redimet
      Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus</i>, with extraordinary jubilation.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night Abbe Mouret slept very heavily. When he opened his eyes in the
      morning, later than usual, his face and hands were wet with tears. He had
      been weeping all through the night while he slept. He did not say his mass
      that day. In spite of his long rest, he had not recovered from his
      excessive weariness of the previous evening, and he remained in his
      bedroom till noon, sitting in a chair at the foot of his bed. The
      condition of stupor into which he more and more deeply sank, took all
      sensation of suffering away from him. He was conscious only of a great
      void and blank as he sat there overpowered and benumbed. Even to read his
      breviary cost him a great effort. Its Latin seemed to him a barbarous
      language, which he would never again be able to pronounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having tossed the book upon his bed he gazed for hours through his open
      window at the surrounding country. In the far distance he saw the long
      wall of the Paradou, creeping like a thin white line amongst the gloomy
      patches of the pine plantations to the crest of the hills. On the left,
      hidden by one of those plantations, was the breach. He could not see it,
      but he knew it was there. He remembered every bit of bramble scattered
      among the stones. On the previous night he would not have thus dared to
      gaze upon that dreaded scene. But now with impunity he allowed himself to
      trace the whole line of the wall, as it emerged again and again from the
      clumps of verdure which here and there concealed it. His blood pulsed none
      the faster for this scrutiny. Temptation, as though disdaining his present
      weakness, left him free from attack. Forsaken by the Divine grace, he was
      incapable of entering upon any struggle, the thought of sin could no
      longer even impassion him; it was sheer stupor alone that now rendered him
      willing to accept that which he had the day before so strenuously refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment he caught himself talking aloud and saying that, since the
      breach in the wall was still open, he would go and join Albine at sunset.
      This decision brought him a slight feeling of worry, but he did not think
      that he could do otherwise. She was expecting him to go, and she was his
      wife. When he tried to picture her face, he could only imagine her as very
      pale and a long way off. Then he felt a little uneasy as to their future
      manner of life together. It would be difficult for them to remain in the
      neighbourhood; they would have to go away somewhere, without any one
      knowing anything about it. And then, when they had managed to conceal
      themselves, they would need a deal of money in order to live happily and
      comfortably. He tried a score of times to hit upon some scheme by which
      they could get away and live together like happy lovers, but he could
      devise nothing satisfactory. Now that he was no longer wild with passion,
      the practical side of the situation alarmed him. He found himself, in all
      his weakness, face to face with a complicated problem with which he was
      incompetent to grapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could they get horses for their escape? And if they went away on
      foot, would they not be stopped and detained as vagabonds? Was he capable
      of securing any employment by which he could earn bread for his wife? He
      had never been taught any kind of trade. He was quite ignorant of actual
      life. He ransacked his memory, and he could remember nothing but strings
      of prayers, details of ceremonies, and pages of Bouvier&rsquo;s &lsquo;Instruction
      Theologique,&rsquo; which he had learned by heart at the seminary. He worried
      too over matters of no real concern. He asked himself whether he would
      dare to give his arm to his wife in the street. He certainly could not
      walk with a woman clinging to his arm. He would surely appear so strange
      and awkward that every one would turn round to stare at him. They would
      guess that he was a priest and would insult Albine. It would be vain for
      him to try to obliterate the traces of his priesthood. He would always
      wear that mournful pallor and carry the odour of incense about with him.
      And what if he should have children some day? As this thought suddenly
      occurred to him, he quite started. He felt a strange repugnance at the
      very idea. He felt sure that he should not care for any children that
      might be born to him. Suppose there were two of them, a little boy and a
      little girl. He could never let them get on his knees; it would distress
      him to feel their hands clutching at his clothes. The thought of the
      little girl troubled him the most; he could already see womanly tenderness
      shining in the depths of her big, childish eyes. No! no! he would have no
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he resolved that he would flee with Albine that evening. But
      when the evening came, he felt too weary. So he deferred his flight till
      the next morning. And the next morning he made a fresh pretext for delay.
      He could not leave his sister alone with La Teuse. He would prepare a
      letter, directing that she should be taken to her uncle Pascal&rsquo;s. For
      three days he was ever on the point of writing that letter, and the paper
      and pen and ink were lying ready on the table in his room. Then, on the
      third day, he went off, leaving the letter unwritten. He took up his hat
      quite suddenly and set off for the Paradou in a state of mingled stupor
      and resignation, as though he were unwillingly performing some compulsory
      task which he saw no means of avoiding. Albine&rsquo;s image was now effaced
      from his memory; he no longer beheld her, but he was driven on by old
      resolves whose lingering influence, though they themselves were dead,
      still worked upon him in his silence and loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no pains to escape notice when he set foot out of doors. He
      stopped at the end of the village to talk for a moment to Rosalie. She
      told him that her baby was suffering from convulsions; but she laughed, as
      she spoke, with the laugh that was natural to her. Then he struck out
      through the rocks, and walked straight on towards the breach in the wall.
      By force of habit he had brought his breviary with him. Finding the way
      long, he opened the book and read the regulation prayers. When he put it
      back again under his arm, he had forgotten the Paradou. He went on walking
      steadily, thinking about a new chasuble that he wished to purchase to
      replace the old gold-broidered one, which was certainly falling into
      shreds. For some time past he had been saving up twenty-sous pieces, and
      he calculated that by the end of seven months he would have got the
      necessary amount of money together. He had reached the hills when the song
      of a peasant in the distance reminded him of a canticle which had been
      familiar to him at the seminary. He tried to recall the first lines of it,
      but his recollection failed him. It vexed him to find that his memory was
      so poor. And when, at last, he succeeded in remembering the words, he
      found a soothing pleasure in humming the verses, which came back to his
      mind one by one. It was a hymn of homage to Mary. He smiled as though some
      soft breath from the days of his childhood were playing upon his face. Ah!
      how happy he had then been! Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be as happy again? He had not
      grown any bigger, he wanted nothing more than the same old happiness,
      unruffled peace, a nook in the chapel, where his knees marked his place, a
      life of seclusion, enlivened by the delightful puerilities of childhood.
      Little by little he raised his voice, singing the canticle in flutelike
      tones, when he suddenly became aware of the breach immediately in front of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he seemed surprised. Then, the smile dying from his face, he
      murmured quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albine must be expecting me. The sun is already setting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as he was about to push some stones aside to make himself a
      passage, he was startled by a snore. He sprang down again: he had only
      just missed setting his foot upon the very face of Brother Archangias, who
      was lying on the ground there sleeping soundly. Slumber had overtaken him
      while he kept guard over the entrance to the Paradou. He barred the
      approach to it, lying at full length before its threshold, with arms and
      legs spread out. His right hand, thrown back behind his head, still
      clutched his dogwood staff, which he seemed to brandish like a fiery
      sword. And he snored loudly in the midst of the brambles, his face exposed
      to the sun, without a quiver on his tanned skin. A swarm of big flies was
      hovering over his open mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret looked at him for a moment. He envied the slumber of that
      dust-wallowing saint. He wished to drive the flies away, but they
      persistently returned, and clung around the purple lips of the Brother,
      who was quite unconscious of their presence. Then the Abbe strode over his
      big body and entered the Paradou.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Albine was seated on a patch of grass a few paces away from the wall. She
      sprang up as she caught sight of Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you have come!&rsquo; she cried, trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered calmly, &lsquo;I have come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself upon his neck, but she did not kiss him. To her bare
      arms the beads of his neckband seemed very cold. She scrutinised him,
      already feeling uneasy, and resuming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with you? Why don&rsquo;t you kiss my cheeks as you used to
      do? Oh! if you are ill, I will cure you once again. Now that you are here,
      all our old happiness will return. There will be no more wretchedness....
      See! I am smiling. You must smile, too, Serge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But his face remained grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been troubled, too,&rsquo; she went on. &lsquo;I am still quite pale, am I
      not? For a whole week I have been living on that patch of grass, where you
      found me. I wanted one thing only, to see you coming back through the
      breach in the wall. At every sound I sprang up and rushed to meet you.
      But, alas! it was not you I heard. It was only the leaves rustling in the
      wind. But I was sure that you would come. I should have waited for you for
      years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you still love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I love you still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other, feeling rather ill at ease. And deep
      silence fell between them. Serge, who evinced perfect calmness, did not
      attempt to break it. Albine twice opened her mouth to speak, but closed it
      immediately, surprised at the words that rose to her lips. She could
      summon up nothing but expressions tinged with bitterness. She felt tears
      welling into her eyes. What could be the matter with her that she did not
      feel happy now that her love had come back?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; she said at last. &lsquo;We must not stay here. It is that hole
      that freezes us! Let us go back to our old home. Give me your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They plunged into the depths of the Paradou. Autumn was fast approaching,
      and the trees seemed anxious as they stood there with their yellowing
      crests from which the leaves were falling one by one. The paths were
      already littered with dead foliage soaked with moisture, which gave out a
      sound as of sighing beneath one&rsquo;s tread. And away beyond the lawns misty
      vapour ascended, throwing a mourning veil over the blue distance. And the
      whole garden was wrapped in silence, broken only by some sorrowful moans
      that sounded quiveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge began to shiver beneath the avenue of tall trees, along which they
      were walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How cold it is here!&rsquo; said he in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are cold indeed,&rsquo; murmured Albine, sadly. &lsquo;My hand is no longer able
      to warm you. Shall I wrap you round with part of my dress? Come, all our
      love will now be born afresh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him to the parterre, the flower-garden. The great thicket-like
      rosary was still fragrant with perfume, but there was a tinge of
      bitterness in the scent of the surviving blossoms, and their foliage,
      which had expanded in wild profusion, lay strewn upon the ground. Serge
      displayed such unwillingness to enter the tangled jungle, that they
      lingered on its borders, trying to detect in the distance the paths along
      which they had passed in the spring-time. Albine recollected every little
      nook. She pointed to the grotto where the marble woman lay sleeping; to
      the hanging screens of honeysuckle and clematis; the fields of violets;
      the fountain that spurted out crimson carnations; the steps down which
      flowed golden gilliflowers; the ruined colonnade, in the midst of which
      the lilies were rearing a snowy pavilion. It was there that they had been
      born again beneath the sunlight. And she recapitulated every detail of
      that first day together, how they had walked, and how fragrant had been
      the air beneath the cool shade. Serge seemed to be listening, but he
      suddenly asked a question which showed that he had not understood her. The
      slight shiver which made his face turn pale never left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she led him towards the orchard, but they could not reach it. The
      stream was too much swollen. Serge no longer thought of taking Albine upon
      his back and lightly bounding across with her to the other side. Yet there
      the apple-trees and the pear-trees were still laden with fruit, and the
      vines, now with scantier foliage, bent beneath the weight of their
      gleaming clusters, each grape freckled by the sun&rsquo;s caress. Ah! how they
      had gambolled beneath the appetising shade of those ancient trees! What
      merry children had they then been! Albine smiled as she thought of how she
      had clambered up into the cherry-tree that had broken down beneath her.
      He, Serge, must at least remember what a quantity of plums they had eaten.
      He only answered by a nod. He already seemed quite weary. The orchard,
      with its green depths and chaos of mossy trunks, disquieted him and
      suggested to his mind some dark, dank spot, teeming with snakes and
      nettles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she led him to the meadow-lands, where he had to take a few steps
      amongst the grass. It reached to his shoulders now, and seemed to him like
      a swarm of clinging arms that tried to bind his limbs and pull him down
      and drown him beneath an endless sea of greenery. He begged Albine to go
      no further. She was walking on in front, and at first she did not stop;
      but when she saw how distressed he appeared, she halted and came back and
      stood beside him. She also was growing gradually more low-spirited, and at
      last she shuddered like himself. Still she went on talking. With a
      sweeping gesture she pointed out to him the streams, the rows of willows,
      the grassy expanse stretching far away towards the horizon. All that had
      formerly been theirs. For whole days they had lived there. Over yonder,
      between those three willows by the water&rsquo;s edge, they had played at being
      lovers. And they would then have been delighted if the grass had been
      taller than themselves so that they might have lost themselves in its
      depths, and have been the more secluded, like larks nesting at the bottom
      of a field of corn. Why, then, did he tremble so to-day, when the tip of
      his foot just sank into the grass?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she led him to the forest. But the huge trees seemed to inspire Serge
      with still greater dread. He did not know them again, so sternly solemn
      seemed their bare black trunks. Here, more than anywhere else, amidst
      those austere columns, through which the light now freely streamed, the
      past seemed quite dead. The first rains had washed the traces of their
      footsteps from the sandy paths, the winds had swept every other lingering
      memorial into the underbrush. But Albine, with grief at her throat, shot
      out a protesting glance. She could still plainly see their lightest
      footprints on the sandy gravel, and, as they passed each bush, the warmth
      with which they had once brushed against it surged to her cheeks. With
      eyes full of soft entreaty, she still strove to awaken Serge&rsquo;s memory. It
      was along that path that they had walked in silence, full of emotion, but
      as yet not daring to confess that they loved one another. It was in that
      clearing that they had lingered one evening till very late watching the
      stars, which had rained upon them like golden drops of warmth. Farther,
      beneath that oak they had exchanged their first kiss. Its fragrance still
      clung to the tree, and the very moss still remembered it. It was false to
      say that the forest had become voiceless and bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, however, turned away his head, that he might escape the gaze of
      Albine&rsquo;s eyes, which oppressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she led him to the great rocks. There, perhaps, he would no longer
      shudder with that appearance of debility which so distressed her. At that
      hour the rocks were still warm with the red glow of the setting sun. They
      still wore an aspect of tragic passion, with their hot ledges of stone
      whereon the fleshy plants writhed monstrously. Without speaking a word,
      without even turning her head, Albine led Serge up the rough ascent,
      wishing to take him ever higher and higher, far up beyond the springs,
      till they should emerge into the full light on the summit. They would
      there see the cedar, beneath whose shade they had first felt the thrill of
      desire, and there amidst the glowing stones they would assuredly find
      passion once more. But Serge soon began to stumble pitiably. He could walk
      no further. He fell a first time on his knees. Albine, by a mighty effort,
      raised him and for a moment carried him along, but afterwards he fell
      again, and remained, quite overcome, on the ground. In front of him,
      beneath him, spread the vast Paradou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have lied!&rsquo; cried Albine. &lsquo;You love me no longer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears as she stood there by his side, feeling that she
      could not carry him any higher. There was no sign of anger in her now. She
      was simply weeping over their dying love. Serge lay dazed and stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The garden is all dead. I feel so very cold,&rsquo; he murmured. But she took
      his head between her hands, and showed him the Paradou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at it! Ah! it is your eyes that are dead; your ears and your limbs
      and your whole body. You have passed by all the scenes of our happiness
      without seeing them or hearing them or feeling their presence. You have
      done nothing but slip and stumble, and now you have fallen down here in
      sheer weariness and boredom.... You love me no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested, but in a gentle, quiet fashion. Then, for the first time,
      she spoke out passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quiet! As if the garden could ever die! It will sleep for the winter,
      but it will wake up again in May, and will restore to us all the love we
      have entrusted to its keeping. Our kisses will blossom again amongst the
      flower-beds, and our vows will bud again with the trees and plants. If you
      could only see it and understand it, you would know that it throbs with
      even deeper passion, and loves even more absorbingly at this autumn-time,
      when it falls asleep in its fruitfulness.... But you love me no more, and
      so you can no longer understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes to her as if begging her not to be angry. His face was
      pinched and pale with an expression of childish fear. The sound of her
      voice made him tremble. He ended by persuading her to rest a little while
      by his side. They could talk quietly and discuss matters. Then, with the
      Paradou spreading out in front of them, they began to speak of their love,
      but without even touching one another&rsquo;s fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you; indeed I love you,&rsquo; said Serge, in his calm, quiet voice. &lsquo;If
      I did not love you, I should not be here: I should not have come. I am
      very weary, it is true. I don&rsquo;t know why. I thought I should find that
      pleasant warmth again, of which the mere memory was so delightful. But I
      am cold, the garden seems quite black. I cannot see anything of what I
      left here. But it is not my fault. I am trying hard to be as you would
      wish me and to please you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You love me no longer!&rsquo; Albine repeated once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do love you. I suffered grievously the other day after I had
      driven you away.... Oh! I loved you with such passion that, had you come
      back and thrown yourself in my arms, I should almost have crushed you to
      death.... And for hours your image remained present before me. When I shut
      my eyes, you gleamed out with all the brightness of the sun and threw a
      flame around me.... Then I trampled down every obstacle, and came here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent for a moment, as if in thought. Then he spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now my arms feel as though they were broken. If I tried to clasp you,
      I could not hold you; I should let you fall.... Wait till this shudder has
      passed away. Give me your hands, and let me kiss them again. Be gentle and
      do not look at me with such angry eyes. Help me to find my heart again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with such genuine sadness, such evident longing to begin the past
      anew, that Albine was touched. For a moment all her wonted gentleness
      returned to her, and she questioned him anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with you? What makes you so ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know. It is as though all my blood had left my veins. Just now,
      as I was coming here, I felt as if some one had flung a robe of ice around
      my shoulders, which turned me into stone from head to foot.... I have felt
      it before, but where I don&rsquo;t remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him with a kindly laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a child. You have caught cold, that&rsquo;s all. At any rate, it is not
      I that you are afraid of, is it? We won&rsquo;t stop in the garden during the
      winter, like a couple of wild things. We will go wherever you like, to
      some big town. We can love each other there, amongst all the people, as
      quietly as amongst the trees. You will see that I can be something else
      than a wilding, for ever bird&rsquo;s-nesting and tramping about for hours. When
      I was a little girl, I used to wear embroidered skirts and fine stockings
      and laces and all kinds of finery. I dare say you never heard of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not listening to her. He suddenly gave vent to a little cry, and
      said: &lsquo;Ah! now I recollect!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him what he meant, but he would not answer her. He had just
      remembered the feeling he had long ago experienced in the chapel of the
      seminary. That was the icy robe enwrapping his shoulders and turning him
      to stone. And then his life as a priest took complete possession of his
      thoughts. The vague recollections which had haunted him as he walked from
      Les Artaud to the Paradou became more and more distinct and assumed
      complete mastery over him. While Albine talked on of the happy life that
      they would lead together, he heard the tinkling of the sanctuary bell that
      signalled the elevation of the Host, and he saw the monstrance trace
      gleaming crosses over the heads of kneeling multitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And for your sake,&rsquo; Albine was saying, &lsquo;I will put on my broidered skirts
      again.... I want you to be bright and gay. We will try to find something
      to make you lively. Perhaps you will love me better when you see me
      looking beautiful and prettily dressed, like a fine lady. I will wear my
      comb properly and won&rsquo;t let my hair fall wildly about my neck any more.
      And I won&rsquo;t roll my sleeves up over my elbows; I will fasten my dress so
      as to hide my shoulders. I still know how to bow and how to walk along
      quite properly. Yes, I will make you a nice little wife, as I walk through
      the streets leaning on your arm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever go to church when you were a little girl?&rsquo; he asked her in
      an undertone, as if, in spite of himself, he were continuing aloud the
      reverie which prevented him from hearing her. &lsquo;I could never pass a church
      without entering it. As soon as the door closed silently behind me, I felt
      as though I were in Paradise itself, with the angels whispering stories of
      love in my ears and the saints caressing me with their breath. Ah! I would
      have liked to live there for ever, in that absorbing beatitude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with steady eyes, a passing blaze kindling in her loving
      glance. Nevertheless, submissive still, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do as you may fancy. I learned music once. I was quite a clever
      young lady and was taught all the accomplishments. I will go back to
      school and start music again. If there is any tune you would like to hear
      me play, you will only have to tell me, and I will practise it for months
      and months, so as to play it to you some evening in our own home when we
      are by ourselves in some snug little room, with the curtains closely
      drawn. And you will pay me with just one kiss, won&rsquo;t you? A kiss right on
      the lips, which will awaken all your love again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; he murmured, answering his own thoughts only; &lsquo;my great
      pleasure at first was to light the candles, prepare the cruets, and carry
      the missal. Then, afterwards, I was filled with bliss at the approach of
      God, and felt as though I could die of sheer love. Those are my only
      recollections. I know of nothing else. When I raise my hand, it is to give
      a benediction. When my lips protrude it is to kiss the altar. If I look
      for my heart, I can no longer find it. I have offered it to God, and He
      has taken it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine grew very pale and her eyes gleamed like fire. In a quivering voice
      she resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not like my little girl to leave me. You can send the boy to
      college, if you wish, but the little girl must always keep with me. I
      myself will teach her to read. Oh! I shall remember everything, and if
      indeed there be anything that I find I have forgotten, I will have masters
      to teach me.... Yes, we will keep our dear little ones always about our
      knees. You will be happy so, won&rsquo;t you? Speak to me; tell me that you will
      then feel warm again, and will smile, and feel no regrets for anything you
      have left behind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Serge continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have often thought of the stone-saints that have been censed in their
      niches for centuries past. They must have become quite saturated with
      incense; and I am like one of them. I have the fragrance of incense in the
      inmost parts of my being. It is that embalmment that gives me serenity,
      deathlike tranquillity of body, and the peace which I enjoy in no longer
      living.... Ah! may nothing ever disturb my quiescence! May I ever remain
      cold and rigid, with a ceaseless smile on my granite lips, incapable of
      descending among men! That is my one, my only desire!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Albine sprang to her feet, exasperated, threatening. She shook
      Serge and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you saying? What is it you are dreaming aloud? Am I not your
      wife? Haven&rsquo;t you come here to be my husband?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He recoiled, trembling yet more violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! Leave me! I am afraid!&rsquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But our life together, our happiness, the children we shall have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; I am afraid.&rsquo; And he broke out into a supreme cry: &lsquo;I cannot! I
      cannot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Albine remained silent, gazing at the unhappy man who lay
      shivering at her feet. Her face flared. She opened her arms as if to seize
      him and strain him to her breast with wild angry passion. But another idea
      came to her, and she merely took him by the hand and raised him to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him away to that giant tree, to the very spot where their love had
      reigned supreme. There was the same bliss-inspiring shade, there was the
      same trunk as of yore, the same branches spreading far around, like
      sheltering and protecting arms. The tree still towered aloft, kindly,
      robust, powerful, and fertile. As on the day of their nuptials, languorous
      warmth, the glimmer of a summer&rsquo;s night fading on the bare shoulder of
      some fair girl, a sob of love dying away into passionate silence, lingered
      about the clearing as it lay there bathed in dim green light. And, in the
      distance, the Paradou, in spite of the first chills of autumn, sighed once
      more with passion, again becoming love&rsquo;s accomplice. From the parterre,
      from the orchard, from the meadow-lands, from the forest, from the great
      rocks, from the spreading heavens, came back a ripple of voluptuous joy.
      Never had the garden, even on the warmest evenings of spring-time, shown
      such deep tenderness as now, on this fair autumn evening, when the plants
      and trees seemed to be bidding one another goodnight ere they sank to
      sleep. And the scent of ripened germs wafted the intoxication of desire
      athwart the scanty leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear? Do you hear?&rsquo; faltered Albine in Serge&rsquo;s ear, when she had
      let him slip upon the grass at the foot of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge was weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see that the Paradou is not dead,&rsquo; she added. &lsquo;It is crying out to us
      to love each other. It still desires our union. Oh, do remember! Clasp me
      to your heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge still wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albine said nothing more. She flung her arms around him; she pressed her
      warm lips to his corpse-like face; but tears were still his only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a long silence, Albine spoke. She stood erect, full of
      contempt and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away with you! Go!&rsquo; she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge rose with difficulty. He picked up his breviary, which had fallen
      upon the grass. And he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away with you! Go!&rsquo; repeated Albine, in louder tones, as she followed and
      drove him before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she urged him on from bush to bush till she had driven him back to
      the breach in the wall, in the midst of the stern-looking trees. And
      there, as she saw Serge hesitate, with lowered head she cried out
      violently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away with you Go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And slowly she herself went back into the Paradou, without even turning
      her head. Night was fast falling, and the garden was but a huge bier of
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Brother Archangias, aroused from his slumber, stood erect in the breach,
      striking the stones with his stick and swearing abominably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May the devil break their legs for them! May he drag them to hell by
      their feet, with their noses trailing in their abomination!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he saw Albine driving away the priest, he stopped for a moment in
      surprise. Then he struck the stones yet more vigorously, and burst into a
      roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, you hussy! A pleasant journey to you! Go back to your mates the
      wolves! A priest is no fit companion for such as you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking at Abbe Mouret, he growled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you were in there. I saw that the stones had been disturbed....
      Listen to me, Monsieur le Cure. Your sin has made me your superior, and
      God tells you, through my mouth, that hell has no torments severe enough
      for a priest who lets himself succumb to the lusts of the flesh. If He
      were to pardon you now, He would be too indulgent, it would be contrary to
      His own justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They slowly walked down the hill towards Les Artaud. The priest had not
      opened his lips; but gradually he raised his head erect: he was no longer
      trembling. As in the distance he caught sight of the Solitaire looming
      blackly against the purplish sky, and the ruddy glow of the tiles on the
      church, a faint smile came to his lips, while to his calm eyes there rose
      an expression of perfect serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the Brother was every now and then giving a vicious kick at the
      stones that came in his way. Presently he turned to his companion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it all over this time?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;When I was your age I was possessed
      too. A demon was ever gnawing at me. But, after a time, he grew weary of
      it, and took himself off. Now that he has gone I live quietly enough....
      Oh! I knew very well that you would go. For three weeks past I have been
      keeping watch upon you. I used to look into the garden through the breach
      in the wall. I should have liked to cut the trees down. I have often
      hurled stones at them; it was delightful to break the branches. Tell me,
      now, is it so very nice to be there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made Abbe Mouret stop in the middle of the road, and glared at him with
      a terrible expression of jealousy. The thought of the priest&rsquo;s life in the
      Paradou tortured him. But the Abbe kept perfect silence, so Archangias set
      off again, jeering as he went. Then, in a louder voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, when a priest behaves as you have done, he scandalises every
      other priest. I myself felt sullied by your conduct. However, you are now
      behaving more sensibly. There is no need for you to make any confession. I
      know what has happened well enough. Heaven has broken your back for you,
      as it has done for so many others. So much the better! So much the
      better!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He clapped his hands triumphantly. But Abbe Mouret, immersed in deep
      reverie, with a smile spreading over his whole face, did not even hear
      him. When the Brother quitted him at the parsonage door, he went round and
      entered the church. It was grey and gloomy, as on that terrible rainy
      evening when temptation had racked him so violently. And it still remained
      poverty-stricken and meditative, bare of all that gleaming gold and
      sighing passion that had seemed to him to sweep in from the countryside.
      It preserved solemn silence. But a breath of mercy seemed to fill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling before the great Christ and bursting into tears, which he let
      flow down his cheeks as though they were so many blessings, the priest
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O God, it is not true that Thou art pitiless. I know it, I feel it: Thou
      hast already pardoned me. I feel it in the outpouring of Thy grace, which,
      for hours now, has been flowing through me in a sweet stream, bringing me
      back, slowly but surely, perfect peace and spiritual health. O God, it was
      at the very moment when I was about to forsake Thee that Thou didst
      protect me most effectually. Thou didst hide Thyself from me, the better
      to rescue me from evil. Thou didst allow my flesh to run its course, that
      I might be convinced of its nothingness. And now, O God, I see that Thou
      hast for ever marked me with Thy seal, that awful seal, pregnant with
      blessings, which sets a man apart from other men, and whose mark is so
      ineffaceable that, sooner or later, it makes itself manifest even upon
      those who sin. Thou hast broken me with sin and temptation. Thou hast
      ravaged me with Thy flames. Thou hast willed that there should be nought
      left of me save ruins wherein Thou mightest safely descend. I am an empty
      tabernacle wherein Thou may&rsquo;st dwell. Blessed art Thou, O God!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He prostrated himself and continued stammering in the dust. The church
      triumphed. It remained firm and unshaken over the priest&rsquo;s head, with its
      altars and its confessional, its pulpit, its crosses, and its holy images.
      The world had ceased to exist. Temptation was extinguished like a fire
      that was henceforth unnecessary for the Abbe&rsquo;s purification. He was
      entering into supernatural peace. And he raised this supreme cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the exclusion of life and its creatures and of everything that be in
      it, I belong to Thee, O God; to Thee, Thee alone, through all eternity!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At that moment Albine was still wandering about the Paradou with all the
      mute agony of a wounded animal. She had ceased to weep. Her face was very
      white and a deep crease showed upon her brow. Why did she have to suffer
      that deathlike agony? Of what fault had she been guilty, that the garden
      no longer kept the promises it had held out to her since her childhood&rsquo;s
      days? She questioned herself as she walked along, never heeding the
      avenues through which the gloom was slowly stealing. She had always obeyed
      the voices of the trees. She could not remember having injured a single
      flower. She had ever been the beloved daughter of the greenery, hearkening
      to it submissively, yielding to it with full belief in the happiness which
      it promised to her. And when, on that supreme day, the Paradou had cried
      to her to cast herself beneath the giant-tree, she had done so in
      compliance with its voice. If she then had nothing to reproach herself
      with, it must be the garden which had betrayed her; the garden which was
      torturing her for the mere sake of seeing her suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted and looked around her. The great gloomy masses of foliage
      preserved deep silence. The paths were blocked with black walls of
      darkness. The distant lawns were lulling to sleep the breezes that kissed
      them. And she thrust out her hands with a gesture of hopelessness and
      raised a cry of protest. It could not all end thus. But her voice choked
      beneath the silent trees. Thrice did she implore the Paradou to answer
      her, but never an explanation fell from its lofty branches, not a leaf
      seemed to be moved with pity for her. Then she resumed her weary
      wandering, and felt that she was entering into the fatal sternness of
      winter. Now that she had ceased to rebelliously question the earth, she
      caught sound of a gentle murmur speeding along the ground. It was the
      farewell of the plants, wishing one another a happy death. To have drunk
      in the sunshine for a whole season, to have lived ever blossoming, to have
      breathed continual perfume, and then, at the first blast, to depart, with
      the hope of springing up again elsewhere, was not that sufficiently long
      and full a life which obstinate craving for further existence would mar?
      Ah! how sweet death must be; how sweet to have an endless night before
      one, wherein to dream of the short days of life and to recall eternally
      its fugitive joys!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stayed her steps once more; but she no longer protested as she stood
      there amidst the deep stillness of the Paradou. She now believed that she
      understood everything. The garden doubtless had death in store for her as
      a supreme culminating happiness. It was to death that it had all along
      been leading her in its tender fashion. After love, there could be nought
      but death. And never had the garden loved her so much as it did now; she
      had shown herself ungrateful in accusing it, for all the time she had
      remained its best beloved child. The motionless boughs, the paths blocked
      up with darkness, the lawns where the breezes fell asleep, had only become
      mute in order that they might lure her on to taste the joys of long
      silence. They wished her to be with them in their winter rest, they dreamt
      of carrying her off, swathed in their dry leaves with her eyes frozen like
      the waters of the springs, her limbs stiffened like the bare branches, and
      her blood sleeping the sleep of the sap. And, yes, she would live their
      life to the very end, and die their death. Perhaps they had already willed
      that she should spring up next summer as a rose in the flower-garden, or a
      pale willow in the meadow-lands, or a tender birch in the forest. Yes, it
      was the great law of life; she was about to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the last time, she resumed her walk through the Paradou in quest
      of death. What fragrant plant might need her sweet-scented tresses to
      increase the perfume of its leaves? What flower might wish the gift of her
      satinlike skin, the snowy whiteness of her arms, the tender pink of her
      bosom? To what weakly tree should she offer her young blood? She would
      have liked to be of service to the weeds vegetating beside the paths, to
      slay herself there so that from her flesh some huge greenery might spring,
      lofty and sapful, laden with birds at May-time, and passionately caressed
      by the sun. But for a long while the Paradou still maintained silence as
      if it had not yet made up its mind to confide to her in what last kiss it
      would spirit away her life. She had to wander all over it again, seeking,
      pilgrim-like, for her favourite spots. Night was now more swiftly
      approaching, and it seemed to her as if she were being gradually sucked
      into the earth. She climbed to the great rocks and questioned them, asking
      whether it was upon their stony beds that she must breathe her last
      breath. She crossed the forest with lingering steps, hoping that some oak
      would topple down and bury her beneath the majesty of its fall. She
      skirted the streams that flowed through the meadows, bending down at
      almost every step she took so as to peep into the depths and see whether a
      couch had not been prepared for her amongst the water lilies. But nowhere
      did Death call her; nowhere did he offer her his cold hands. Yet, she was
      not mistaken. It was, indeed, the Paradou that was about to teach her to
      die, as, indeed, it had taught her to love. She again began to scour the
      bushes, more eagerly even than on those warm mornings of the past when she
      had gone searching for love. And, suddenly, just as she was reaching the
      parterre, she came upon death, amidst all the evening fragrance. She ran
      forward, breaking out into a rapturous laugh. She was to die amongst the
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      First she hastened to the thicket-like rosary. There, in the last
      flickering of the gloaming, she searched the beds and gathered all the
      roses that hung languishing at the approach of winter. She plucked them
      from down below, quite heedless of their thorns; she plucked them in front
      of her, with both hands; she plucked them from above, rising upon tip-toes
      and pulling down the boughs. So eager was she, so desperate was her haste,
      that she even broke the branches, she, who had ever shown herself tender
      to the tiniest blades of grass. Soon her arms were full of roses, she
      tottered beneath her burden of flowers. And having quite stripped the rose
      trees, carrying away even the fallen petals, she turned her steps to the
      pavilion; and when she had let her load of blossoms slip upon the floor of
      the room with the blue ceiling, she again went down to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she sought the violets. She made huge bunches of them, which she
      pressed one by one against her breast. Then she sought the carnations,
      plucking them all, even to the buds; massing them together in big sheaves
      of white blossoms that suggested bowls of milk, and big sheaves of the red
      ones, that seemed like bowls of blood. Then, too, she sought the stocks,
      the patches of mirabilis, the heliotropes and the lilies. She tore the
      last blossoming stocks off by the handful, pitilessly crumpling their
      satin ruches; she devastated the beds of mirabilis, whose flowers were
      scarcely opening to the evening air; she mowed down the field of
      heliotropes, piling her harvest of blooms into a heap; and she thrust
      bundles of lilies under her arms like handles of reeds. When she was again
      laden with as much as she could carry, she returned to the pavilion to
      cast the violets, the carnations, the lilies, the stocks, the heliotrope,
      and the mirabilis by the side of the roses. And then, without stopping to
      draw breath, she went down yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she repaired to that gloomy corner which seemed like the
      graveyard of the flower-garden. A warm autumn had there brought on a
      second crop of spring flowers. She raided the borders of tuberoses and
      hyacinths; going down upon her knees, and gathering her harvest with all a
      miser&rsquo;s care, lest she should miss a single blossom. The tuberoses seemed
      to her to be extremely precious flowers, which would distil drops of gold
      and wealth and wondrous sweetness. The hyacinths, beaded with pearly
      blooms, were like necklets, whose every pearl would pour forth joys
      unknown to man. And although she almost buried herself beneath the mass of
      tuberoses and hyacinths which she plucked, she next stripped a field of
      poppies, and even found means to crop an expanse of marigolds farther on.
      All these she heaped over the tuberoses and hyacinths, and then ran back
      to the room with the blue ceiling, taking the greatest care as she went
      that the breeze should not rob her of a single pistil. And once more did
      she come downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was she to gather now? She had stripped the parterre bare. As she
      rose upon the tips of her shoes in the dim gloom, she could only see the
      garden lying there naked and dead, deprived of the tender eyes of its
      roses, the crimson smile of its carnations, and the perfumed locks of its
      heliotropes. Nevertheless, she could not return with empty arms. So she
      laid hands upon the herbs and leafy plants. She crawled over the ground,
      as though she would have carried off the very soil itself in a clutch of
      supreme passion. She filled her skirt with a harvest of aromatic plants,
      southernwood, mint, verbenas. She came across a border of balm, and left
      not a leaf of it unplucked. She even broke off two big fennels which she
      threw over her shoulders like a couple of trees. Had she been able, she
      would have carried all the greenery of the garden away with her between
      her teeth. When she reached the threshold of the pavilion, she turned
      round and gave a last look at the Paradou. It was quite dark now. The
      night had fully come and cast a black veil over everything. Then for the
      last time she went up the stairs, never more to step down them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacious room was quickly decked. She had placed a lighted lamp upon
      the table. She sorted out the flowers heaped upon the floor and arranged
      them in big bunches, which she distributed about the room. First she
      placed some lilies behind the lamp on the table, forming with them a lofty
      lacelike screen which softened the light with its snowy purity. Then she
      threw handfuls of carnations and stocks over the old sofa, which was
      already strewn with red bouquets that had faded a century ago, till all
      these were hidden, and the sofa looked like a huge bed of stocks bristling
      with carnations. Next she placed the four armchairs in front of the
      alcove. On the first one she piled marigolds, on the second poppies, on
      the third mirabilis, and on the fourth heliotrope. The chairs were
      completely buried in bloom, with nothing but the tips of their arms
      visible. At last she thought of the bed. She pushed a little table near
      the head of it, and reared thereon a huge pile of violets. Then she
      covered the whole bed with the hyacinths and tuberoses she had plucked.
      They were so abundant that they formed a thick couch overflowing all
      around, so that the bed now looked like one colossal bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses still remained. And these she scattered chancewise all over the
      room, without even looking to see where they fell. Some of them dropped
      upon the table, the sofa, and the chairs; and a corner of the bed was
      inundated with them. For some minutes there was a rain of roses, a real
      downpour of heavy blossoms, which settled in flowery pools in the hollows
      of the floor. But as the heap seemed scarcely diminished, she finished by
      weaving garlands of roses which she hung upon the walls. She twined
      wreaths around the necks and arms and waists of the plaster cupids that
      sported over the alcove. The blue ceiling, the oval panels, edged with
      flesh-coloured ribbon, the voluptuous paintings, preyed upon by time, were
      all hung with a mantle, a drapery of roses. The big room was fully decked
      at last. Now she could die there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she remained standing, glancing around her. She was looking
      to see if death was there. And she gathered up the aromatic greenery, the
      southernwood, the mint, the verbenas, the balm, and the fennel. She broke
      them and twisted them and made wedges of them with which to stop up every
      little chink and cranny about the windows and the door. Then she drew the
      white coarsely sewn calico curtains and, without even a sigh, laid herself
      upon the bed, on all the florescence of hyacinths and tuberoses.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a final rapture was granted her. With her eyes wide open she
      smiled at the room. Ah! how she had loved there! And how happily she was
      there going to die! At that supreme moment the plaster cupids suggested
      nothing impure to her; the amorous paintings disturbed her no more. She
      was conscious of nothing beneath that blue ceiling save the intoxicating
      perfume of the flowers. And it seemed to her as if this perfume was none
      other than the old love-fragrance which had always warmed the room, now
      increased a hundredfold, till it had become so strong and penetrating that
      it would surely suffocate her. Perchance it was the breath of the lady who
      had died there a century ago. In perfect stillness, with her hands clasped
      over her heart, she continued smiling, while she listened to the whispers
      of the perfumes in her buzzing head. They were singing to her a soft
      strange melody of fragrance, which slowly and very gently lulled her to
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first there was a prelude, bright and childlike; her hands, that had
      just now twisted and twined the aromatic greenery, exhaled the pungency of
      crushed herbage, and recalled her old girlish ramblings through the
      wildness of the Paradou. Then there came a flutelike song, a song of short
      musky notes, rising from the violets that lay upon the table near the head
      of the bed; and this flutelike strain, trilling melodiously to the soft
      accompaniment of the lilies on the other table, sang to her of the first
      joys of love, its first confession, and first kiss beneath the trees of
      the forest. But she began to stifle as passion drew nigh with the
      clove-like breath of the carnations, which burst upon her in brazen notes
      that seemed to drown all others. She thought that death was nigh when the
      poppies and the marigolds broke into a wailing strain, which recalled the
      torment of desire. But suddenly all grew quieter; she felt that she could
      breathe more freely; she glided into greater serenity, lulled by a
      descending scale that came from the throats of the stocks, and died away
      amidst a delightful hymn from the heliotropes, which, with their
      vanilla-like breath, proclaimed the approach of nuptial bliss. Here and
      there the mirabilis gently trilled. Then came a hush. And afterwards the
      roses languidly made their entry. Their voices streamed from the ceiling,
      like the strains of a distant choir. It was a chorus of great breadth, to
      which she at first listened with a slight quiver. Then the volume of the
      strain increased, and soon her whole frame vibrated with the mighty sounds
      that burst in waves around her. The nuptials were at hand, the trumpet
      blasts of the roses announced them. She pressed her hands more closely to
      her heart as she lay there panting, gasping, dying. When she opened her
      lips for the kiss which was to stifle her, the hyacinths and tuberoses
      shot out their perfume and enveloped her with so deep, so great a sigh
      that the chorus of the roses could be heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, amidst the final gasp of the flowers, Albine died.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      About three o&rsquo;clock the next afternoon, La Teuse and Brother Archangias,
      who were chatting on the parsonage-steps, saw Doctor Pascal&rsquo;s gig come at
      full gallop through the village. The whip was being vigorously brandished
      from beneath the lowered hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can he be off to at that rate?&rsquo; murmured the old servant. &lsquo;He will
      break his neck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig had just reached the rising ground on which the church was built.
      Suddenly, the horse reared and stopped, and the doctor&rsquo;s head, with its
      long white hair all dishevelled appeared from under the hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Serge there?&rsquo; he cried, in a voice full of indignant excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse had stepped to the edge of the hill. &lsquo;Monsieur le Cure is in his
      room,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;He must be reading his breviary. Do you want to speak to
      him? Shall I call him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Pascal, who seemed almost distracted, made an angry gesture with his
      whip hand. Bending still further forward, at the risk of falling out, he
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s reading his breviary, is he? No! no! don&rsquo;t call him. I should
      strangle him, and that would do no good. I wanted to tell him that Albine
      was dead. Dead! do you hear me? Tell him, from me, that she is dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he drove off, lashing his horse so fiercely that it almost bolted.
      But, twenty paces away, he pulled up again, and once more stretching out
      his head, cried loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him, too, from me, that she was <i>enceinte</i>! It will please him
      to know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gig rolled on wildly again, jolting dangerously as it ascended
      the stony hill that led to the Paradou. La Teuse was quite dumbfounded.
      But Brother Archangias sniggered and looked at her with savage delight
      glittering in his eyes. She noticed this at last, and thrust him away from
      her, almost making him fall down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be off with you!&rsquo; she stammered, full of anger, seeking to relieve her
      feelings by abusing him. &lsquo;I shall grow to hate you. Is it possible to
      rejoice at any one&rsquo;s death? I wasn&rsquo;t fond of the girl, myself; but it is
      very sad to die at her age. Be off with you, and don&rsquo;t go on sniggering
      like that, or I will throw my scissors in your face!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only about one o&rsquo;clock that a peasant, who had gone to Plassans to
      sell vegetables, had told Doctor Pascal of Albine&rsquo;s death, and had added
      that Jeanbernat wished to see him. The doctor now was feeling a little
      relieved by what he had just shouted as he passed the parsonage. He had
      gone out of his way expressly to give himself that satisfaction. He
      reproached himself for the death of the girl as for a crime in which he
      had participated. All along the road he had never ceased overwhelming
      himself with insults, and though he wiped the tears from his eyes that he
      might see where to guide his horse, he ever angrily drove his gig over
      heaps of stones, as if hoping that he would overturn himself and break one
      of his limbs. However, when he reached the long lane that skirted the
      endless wall of the park, a glimmer of hope broke upon him. Perhaps Albine
      was only in a dead faint. The peasant had told him that she had suffocated
      herself with flowers. Ah! if he could only get there in time, if he could
      only save her! And he lashed his horse ferociously as though he were
      lashing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely day. The pavilion was all bathed in sunlight, just as it
      had been in the fair spring-time. But the leaves of the ivy which mounted
      to the roof were spotted and patched with rust, and bees no longer buzzed
      round the tall gilliflowers. Doctor Pascal hastily tethered his horse and
      pushed open the gate of the little garden. All around still prevailed that
      perfect silence amidst which Jeanbernat had been wont to smoke his pipe;
      but, to-day, the old man was no longer seated on his bench watching his
      lettuces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jeanbernat!&rsquo; called the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered. Then, on entering the vestibule, he saw something that he
      had never seen before. At the end of the passage, below the dark
      staircase, was a door opening into the Paradou, and he could see the vast
      garden spreading there beneath the pale sunlight, with all its autumn
      melancholy, its sere and yellow foliage. The doctor hurried through the
      doorway and took a few steps over the damp grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it is you, doctor!&rsquo; said Jeanbernat in a calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was digging a hole at the foot of a mulberry-tree. He had
      straightened his tall figure on hearing the approach of footsteps. But he
      promptly betook himself to his task again, throwing out at each effort a
      huge mass of rich soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing there?&rsquo; asked Doctor Pascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanbernat straightened himself again and wiped the sweat off his face
      with the sleeve of his jacket. &lsquo;I am digging a hole,&rsquo; he answered simply.
      &lsquo;She always loved the garden, and it will please her to sleep here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nearly choked with emotion. For a moment he stood by the edge
      of the grave, incapable of speaking, but watching Jeanbernat as the other
      sturdily dug on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she?&rsquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up there, in her room. I left her on the bed. I should like you to go and
      listen to her heart before she is put away in here. I listened myself, but
      I couldn&rsquo;t hear anything at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went upstairs. The room had not been disturbed. Only a window
      had been opened. There the withered flowers, stifled by their own
      perfumes, exhaled but the faint odour of dead beauty. Within the alcove,
      however, there still hung an asphyxiating warmth, which seemed to trickle
      into the room and gradually disperse in tiny puffs. Albine, snowy-pale,
      with her hands upon her heart and a smile playing over her face, lay
      sleeping on her couch of hyacinths and tuberoses. And she was quite happy,
      since she was quite dead. Standing by the bedside, the doctor gazed at her
      for a long time, with a keen expression such as comes into the eyes of
      scientists who attempt to work resurrections. But he did not even disturb
      her clasped hands. He kissed her brow, on the spot where her latent
      maternity had already set a slight shadow. Below, in the garden,
      Jeanbernat was still driving his spade into the ground in heavy, regular
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later, however, the old man came upstairs. He had
      completed his work. He found the doctor seated by the bedside, buried in
      such a deep reverie that he did not seem conscious of the heavy tears that
      were trickling down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men only glanced at each other. Then, after an interval of
      silence, Jeanbernat slowly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, was I not right? There is nothing, nothing, nothing. It is all mere
      nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing and began to pick up the roses that had fallen from
      the bed, throwing them, one by one, upon Albine&rsquo;s skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The flowers,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;live only for a day, while the rough nettles,
      like me, wear out the very stones amidst which they spring.... Now it&rsquo;s
      all over; I can kick the bucket; I am nearly distracted. My last ray of
      sunlight has been snuffed out. It&rsquo;s all nonsense, as I said before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself upon one of the chairs in his turn. He did not shed a
      tear; he bore himself with rigid despair, like some automaton whose
      mechanism is broken. Mechanically he reached out his hand and took a book
      that lay on the little table strewn with violets. It was one of the books
      stored away in the loft, an odd volume of Holbach,* which he had been
      reading since the morning, while watching by Albine&rsquo;s body. As the doctor
      still remained silent, buried in distressful thought, he began to turn its
      pages over. But a sadden idea occurred to him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * Doubtless Holbach&rsquo;s now forgotten <i>Catechism of Nature</i>, into
    which M. Zola himself may well have peeped whilst writing this
    story.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will help me,&rsquo; he said to the doctor, &lsquo;we will carry her
      downstairs, and bury her with all her flowers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Pascal shuddered. Then he explained to the old man that it was not
      allowed for one to keep the dead in that fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! it isn&rsquo;t allowed!&rsquo; cried Jeanbernat. &lsquo;Well, then, I will allow it
      myself! Doesn&rsquo;t she belong to me? Isn&rsquo;t she mine? Do you think I am going
      to let the priests walk off with her? Let them try, if they want to get a
      shot from my gun!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet and waved his book about with a terrible gesture.
      But the doctor caught hold of his hands and clasped them within his own,
      beseeching him to be calm. And for a long time he talked to him, saying
      all that he had upon his mind. He blamed himself, made fragmentary
      confessions of his fault, and vaguely hinted at those who had killed
      Albine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; he said in conclusion, &lsquo;she is yours no longer; you must give
      her up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jeanbernat shook his head, and again waved his hand in token of
      refusal. However, his obstinate resolution was shaken; and at last he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, let them take her, and may she break their arms for them! I
      only wish that she could rise up out of the ground and kill them all with
      fright.... By the way. I have a little business to settle over there. I
      will go to-morrow.... Good-bye, then, doctor. The hole will do for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when the doctor had left, he again sat down by the dead girl&rsquo;s side,
      and gravely resumed the perusal of his book.

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      That morning there was great commotion in the yard at the parsonage. The
      Artaud butcher had just slaughtered Matthew, the pig, in the shed.
      Desiree, quite enthusiastic about it all, had held Matthew&rsquo;s feet, while
      he was being bled, kissing him on the back that he might feel the pain of
      the knife less, and telling him that it was absolutely necessary that he
      should be killed, now that he had got so fat. No one could cut off a
      goose&rsquo;s neck with a single stroke of the hatchet more unconcernedly than
      she could, or gash open a fowl&rsquo;s throat with a pair of scissors. However
      much she loved her charges, she looked upon their slaughter with great
      equanimity. It was quite necessary, she would say. It made room for the
      young ones who were growing up. And that morning she was very gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; grumbled La Teuse every minute, &lsquo;you will end by making
      yourself ill. There is no sense in working yourself up into such a state,
      just because a pig has been slaughtered. You are as red as if you had been
      dancing a whole night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Desiree only clapped her hands and turned away and bustled about
      again. La Teuse, for her part, complained that her legs were sinking under
      her. Since six o&rsquo;clock in the morning her big carcass had been perpetually
      rolling between the kitchen and the yard, for she had black puddings to
      make. It was she who had whisked the blood in two large earthenware pans,
      and she had thought that she would never get finished, since mademoiselle
      was for ever calling her away for mere nothings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be admitted that, at the very moment when the butcher was bleeding
      Matthew, Desiree had been thrilled with wild excitement, for Lisa, the
      cow, was about to calve. And the girl&rsquo;s delight at this had quite turned
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One goes and another comes!&rsquo; she cried, skipping and twirling round.
      &lsquo;Come here, La Teuse! come here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o&rsquo;clock. Every now and then the sound of chanting was wafted
      from the church. A confused murmur of doleful voices, a muttering of
      prayers could be heard amidst scraps of Latin pronounced in louder and
      clearer tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! oh, do come!&rsquo; repeated Desiree for the twentieth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go and toll the bell, now,&rsquo; muttered the old servant. &lsquo;I shall
      never get finished really. What is it that you want now, mademoiselle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not wait for an answer. She threw herself upon a swarm of
      fowls, who were greedily drinking the blood from the pans. And having
      angrily kicked them away, and then covered up the pans, she called to
      Desiree:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a great deal better if, instead of tormenting me, you only
      came to look after these wretched birds. If you let them do as they like
      there will be no black-pudding for you. Do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree only laughed. What of it, if the fowls did drink a few drops of
      the blood? It would fatten them. Then she again tried to drag La Teuse off
      to the cow, but the old servant refused to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go and toll the bell. The procession will be coming out of church
      directly. You know that quite well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the voices in the church rose yet more loudly, and a sound
      of steps could be distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; insisted Desiree, dragging La Teuse towards the stable. &lsquo;Just
      come and look at her, and tell me what ought to be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse shrugged her shoulders. All that the cow wanted was to be left
      alone and not bothered. Then she set off towards the vestry, but, as she
      passed the shed, she raised a fresh cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! there!&rsquo; she shrieked, shaking her fist. &lsquo;Ah! the little wretch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew was lying at full length on his back, with his feet in the air,
      under the shed, waiting to be singed.* The gash which the knife had made
      in his neck was still quite fresh, and was beaded with drops of blood. And
      a little white hen was very delicately picking off these drops of blood
      one by one.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  * In some parts of France pigs, when killed, are singed, not scalded,
    as is, I think, the usual practice in England.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course,&rsquo; quietly remarked Desiree, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s regaling herself.&rsquo; And
      the girl stooped and patted the pig&rsquo;s plump belly, saying: &lsquo;Eh! my fat
      fellow, you have stolen their food too often to grudge them a wee bit of
      your neck now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      La Teuse hastily doffed her apron and threw it round Matthew&rsquo;s neck. Then
      she hurried away and disappeared within the church. The great door had
      just creaked on its rusty hinges, and a burst of chanting rose in the open
      air amidst the quiet sunshine. Suddenly the bell began to toll with slow
      and regular strokes. Desiree, who had remained kneeling beside the pig
      patting his belly, raised her head to listen, while still continuing to
      smile. When she saw that she was alone, having glanced cautiously around,
      she glided away into the cow&rsquo;s stable and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little iron gate of the graveyard, which had been opened quite wide to
      let the body pass, hung against the wall, half torn from its hinges. The
      sunshine slept upon the herbage of the empty expanse, into which the
      funeral procession passed, chanting the last verse of the <i>Miserere</i>.
      Then silence fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Requiem ternam dona ei, Domine</i>,&rsquo; resumed Abbe Mouret, in solemn
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Et lux perpetua luceat ei</i>,&rsquo; Brother Archangias bellowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head walked Vincent, wearing a surplice and bearing the cross, a
      large copper cross, half the silver plating of which had come off. He
      lifted it aloft with both his hands. Then followed Abbe Mouret, looking
      very pale in his black chasuble, but with his head erect, and without a
      quiver on his lips as he chanted the office, gazing into the distance with
      fixed eyes. The flame of the lighted candle which he was carrying scarcely
      showed in the daylight. And behind him, almost touching him, came Albine&rsquo;s
      coffin, borne by four peasants on a sort of litter, painted black. The
      coffin was clumsily covered with too short a pall, and at the lower end of
      it the fresh deal of which it was made could be seen, with the heads of
      the nails sparkling with a steely glitter. Upon the pall lay flowers:
      handfuls of white roses, hyacinths, and tuberoses, taken from the dead
      girl&rsquo;s very bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just be careful!&rsquo; cried Brother Archangias to the peasants, as they
      slightly tilted the litter in order to get it through the gateway. &lsquo;You
      will be upsetting everything on to the ground!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept the coffin in its place with one of his fat hands. With the other&mdash;as
      there was no second clerk&mdash;he was carrying the holy-water vessel, and
      he likewise represented the choirman, the rural guard, who had been unable
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, too, you others,&rsquo; he exclaimed, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a second funeral, that of Rosalie&rsquo;s baby, who had died the
      previous day from an attack of convulsions. The mother, the father, old
      mother Brichet, Catherine, and two big girls, La Rousse and Lisa, were
      there. The two last were carrying the baby&rsquo;s coffin, one supporting each
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly all voices were hushed again, and there came another interval
      whilst the bell continued tolling in slow and desolate accents. The
      funeral procession crossed the entire burial-ground, going towards the
      corner which was formed by the church and the wall of Desiree&rsquo;s
      poultry-yard. Swarms of grasshoppers leaped away at the approaching
      footsteps, and lizards hurried into their holes. A heavy warmth hung over
      this corner of the loamy cemetery. The crackling of the dry grass beneath
      the tramp of the mourners sounded like choking sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! stop where you are!&rsquo; cried the Brother, barring the way before the
      two big girls who were carrying the baby&rsquo;s coffin. &lsquo;Wait for your turn.
      Don&rsquo;t be getting in our legs here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls laid the baby on the ground. Rosalie, Fortune, and old
      mother Brichet were lingering in the middle of the graveyard, while
      Catherine slyly followed Brother Archangias. Albine&rsquo;s grave was on the
      left hand of Abbe Caffin&rsquo;s tomb, whose white stone seemed in the sunshine
      to be flecked with silvery spangles. The deep cavity, freshly dug that
      morning, yawned amidst thick tufts of grass. Big weeds, almost uprooted,
      drooped over the edges, and a fallen flower lay at the bottom, staining
      the dark soil with its crimson petals. When Abbe Mouret came forward, the
      soft earth crumbled and gave way beneath his feet; he was obliged to step
      back to keep himself from slipping into the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ego sum</i>&mdash;&rsquo; he began in a full voice, which rose above the
      mournful tolling of the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the anthem, those who were present instinctively cast furtive
      glances towards the bottom of the empty grave. Vincent, who had planted
      the cross at the foot of the cavity opposite the priest, pushed the loose
      earth with his foot, and amused himself by watching it fall. This drew a
      laugh from Catherine, who was leaning forward from behind him to get a
      better view. The peasants had set the litter on the grass and were
      stretching their arms, while Brother Archangias prepared the sprinkler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here, Voriau!&rsquo; called Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big black dog, who had gone to sniff at the coffin, came back sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why has the dog been brought?&rsquo; exclaimed Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he followed us,&rsquo; said Lisa, smiling quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all chatting together in subdued tones round the baby&rsquo;s coffin.
      The father and mother occasionally forgot all about it, but on catching
      sight of it again, lying between them at their feet, they relapsed into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so old Bambousse wouldn&rsquo;t come?&rsquo; said La Rousse. Mother Brichet
      raised her eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He threatened to break everything to pieces yesterday when the little one
      died,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;No, no, I must say that he is not a good man. Didn&rsquo;t he
      nearly strangle me, crying out that he had been robbed, and that he would
      have given one of his cornfields for the little one to have died three
      days before the wedding?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One can never tell what will happen,&rsquo; remarked Fortune with a knowing
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of the old man putting himself out about it? We are
      married, all the same, now,&rsquo; added Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they exchanged a smile across the little coffin while Lisa and La
      Rousse nudged each other with their elbows. But afterwards they all became
      very serious again. Fortune picked up a clod of earth to throw at Voriau,
      who was now prowling about amongst the old tombstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! they&rsquo;ve nearly finished over there, now!&rsquo; La Rousse whispered very
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Mouret was just concluding the <i>De profundis</i> in front of
      Albine&rsquo;s grave. Then, with slow steps, he approached the coffin, drew
      himself up erect, and gazed at it for a moment without a quiver in his
      glance. He looked taller, his face shone with a serenity that seemed to
      transfigure him. He stooped and picked up a handful of earth, and
      scattered it over the coffin crosswise. Then, in a voice so steady and
      clear that not a syllable was lost, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Revertitur in terrain suam unde erat, et spiritus redit ad Deum qui
      dedit illum</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder ran through those who were present. Lisa seemed to reflect for a
      moment, and then remarked with an expression of worry: &lsquo;It is not very
      cheerful, eh, when one thinks that one&rsquo;s own turn will come some day or
      other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Brother Archangias had now handed the sprinkler to the priest, who
      took it and shook it several times over the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Requiescat in pace</i>,&rsquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Amen</i>,&rsquo; responded Vincent and the Brother together, in tones so
      respectively shrill and deep that Catherine had to cram her fist into her
      mouth to keep from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed, it is certainly not cheerful,&rsquo; continued Lisa. &lsquo;There really
      was nobody at all at that funeral. The graveyard would be quite empty
      without us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard say that she killed herself,&rsquo; said old mother Brichet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; interrupted La Rousse. &lsquo;The Brother didn&rsquo;t want to let her
      be buried amongst Christians, but Monsieur le Cure said that eternity was
      for everybody. I was there. But all the same the Philosopher might have
      come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very moment Rosalie reduced them all to silence by murmuring:
      &lsquo;See! there he is, the Philosopher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanbernat was, indeed, just entering the graveyard. He walked straight to
      the group that stood around Albine&rsquo;s grave; and he stepped along with so
      lithe, so springy a gait, that none of them heard him coming. When he was
      close to them, he remained for a moment behind Brother Archangias and
      seemed to fix his eyes, for an instant, on the nape of the Brother&rsquo;s neck.
      Then, just as the Abbe Mouret was finishing the office, he calmly drew a
      knife from his pocket, opened it, and with a single cut sliced off the
      Brother&rsquo;s right ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no time for any one to interfere. The Brother gave a
      terrible yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The left one will be for another occasion,&rsquo; said Jeanbernat quietly, as
      he threw the ear upon the ground. Then he went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great and so general was the stupefaction that nobody followed him.
      Brother Archangias had dropped upon the heap of fresh soil which had been
      thrown out of the grave. He was staunching his bleeding wound with his
      handkerchief. One of the four peasants who had carried the coffin, wanted
      to lead him away, conduct him home; but he refused with a gesture and
      remained where he was, fierce and sullen, wishing to see Albine lowered
      into the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! it&rsquo;s our turn at last!&rsquo; said Rosalie with a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abbe Mouret still lingered by the grave, watching the bearers who were
      slipping cords under Albine&rsquo;s coffin in order that they might let it down
      gently. The bell was still tolling; but La Teuse must have been getting
      tired, for it tolled irregularly, as though it were becoming a little
      irritated at the length of the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was growing hotter and the Solitaire&rsquo;s shadow crept slowly over
      the grass and the grave mounds. When Abbe Mouret was obliged to step back
      in order to give the bearers room, his eyes lighted upon the marble
      tombstone of Abbe Caffin, that priest who also had loved, and who was now
      sleeping there so peacefully beneath the wild-flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, even as the coffin descended, supported by the cords,
      whose knots made it strain and creak, a tremendous uproar arose in the
      poultry-yard on the other side of the wall. The goat began to bleat. The
      ducks, the geese, and the turkeys raised their loudest calls and flapped
      their wings. The fowls all cackled at once. The yellow cock, Alexander,
      crowed forth his trumpet notes. The rabbits could even be heard leaping in
      their hutches and shaking their wooden floors. And, above all this lifeful
      uproar of the animal creation, a loud laugh rang out. There was a rustling
      of skirts. Desiree, with her hair streaming, her arms bare to the elbows,
      and her face crimson with triumph, burst into sight, her hands resting
      upon the coping of the wall. She had doubtless climbed upon the
      manure-heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge!&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Albine&rsquo;s coffin had reached the bottom of the grave. The
      cords had just been withdrawn. One of the peasants was throwing the first
      shovelful of earth into the cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serge! Serge!&rsquo; Desiree cried, still more loudly, clapping her hands, &lsquo;the
      cow has got a calf!&rsquo; 
    </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
